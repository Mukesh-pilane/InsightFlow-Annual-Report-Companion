       " '2022-23 This year’s theme reflects the agility that enterprises require  to thrive in a fast-changing, uncertain world. For two years,  enterprises battled for scarce talent to embrace the cloud and  experiment with powerful technologies like AI and ML. They had  just gotten started on their growth and transformation journeys  when the war in Europe changed everything. With raging  inflation and resultant interest rate hikes dampening global  economic outlook, companies are now recalibrating their plans  and adapting to the changed circumstances.  TCS, with its full services capability, helps clients thrive in good  times and bad. It helped them move to the cloud, accelerate  their innovation, adopt new business models and drive  competitive differentiation. Now it is helping them adapt,  transforming their operations and giving them the agility,  resilience and efficiency needed to weather the storm. Its clients  see it as their preferred all-weather partner, making its services  an enterprise staple, and its business very resilient.',\n",

       " 'K Ananth Krishnan I am pleased to share that your company has done well in a  volatile global environment in the year gone by. In FY 2023,  your company delivered revenue of  ₹225,458 crore , a growth of  17.6%.  This growth has come at an industry-leading operating  margin of  24.1%.  TCS continues to play a crucial role with clients to enable  their business transformation, helping them accelerate new  technology adoption and bring agility into execution. We work  with large enterprises on transformation initiatives to build a  digital foundation for the future, enable strategic leverage of  data and artificial intelligence (AI) and reimagine customer and  employee experiences.  Your company delivered healthy client metrics enabled by  new customer additions and deep client relationships.  In FY 2023, growth has come from broad-based performance  across markets and industry verticals. The order book continues  to be strong, indicating demand for your company’s services.  From a talent perspective, the employee strength grew to over  614,000 associates with 35.7% women associates. The global environment is going through considerable changes.  Geopolitical factors such as the conflict between Russia and  Ukraine, rising inflation and volatile commodity prices have  caused slowing down of global growth and created stress in the  overall economic environment.  At the same time, the world is navigating several transitions.  Undoubtedly, these transitions will require significant  investments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge  growth opportunity for the IT industry. The global  energy transition  is accelerating. Businesses are  making clear commitments towards a sustainable future.  There are many  innovations across products, services,  manufacturing, and delivery. New business models are also  emerging. This requires investments in technology and  innovation including electric mobility, renewable power,  hydrogen and sustainable fuel. In addition, sustainability  compliance and reporting requirements are fast evolving as new  standards and regulations are coming into play. Across the facets  of this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be  an important enabler for businesses. The  supply chain   transition  resulting from the geo-political  situation is altering the global supply chains. Companies are  rebalancing their supply chains for resilience and efficiency.  New global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India  playing an important role. This is being led by significant capital  investments in technology to set-up ‘digital-first’ manufacturing  and supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem  integration with partners. In the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital  technologies, bringing about a transformation across every  industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made  AI transition  a central focus. The impact of AI and Machine learning is going  to be profound. There is a transition already underway from  predictive AI to generative AI. Majority of the businesses are  still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing  large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT.  There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors.  Leveraging generative AI would further require technology  innovation and investments.  There is another important area that companies need to focus  on – building talent for the future. The energy, supply chain and  AI transitions are going to require companies to reskill/upskill  existing talent base, hire and integrate new talent and invest  in research. Our technology strengths make us well-placed to  respond to the global demand and scale up our talent base.  As the future of work is evolving, enterprises globally are also  assessing their approach to talent. Today, companies can tap  into talent anywhere and leaders need to learn how to harness  the global talent pool effectively. Technology and tools are  facilitating collaboration and enabling virtual and hybrid models  of work. Harnessing this talent will need an approach that  leverages technologies like AI and cloud to enable effective  employee engagement and collaboration.  Your company is significantly investing in building AI capabilities  which include products and platforms that are AI-powered.  Over the last few years, your company has leveraged  partnerships to design and orchestrate a completely indigenous  software-defined 4G/5G network stack. 5G technologies along  with IoT, edge and AI will enable new digital transformation  opportunities across industries, both industrial and consumer.  We will also invest in research areas important for the future,  in collaboration with our global academic partners and start-up  ecosystem.  I would like to thank Rajesh Gopinathan for his contribution  during his tenure as CEO & MD and I wish him the very best for  the future. I also take this opportunity to wish K Krithivasan the  very best in his new role as CEO & MD of your company.  On behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services,  I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and  support. Warm regards,',\n",

On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using  technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed  to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times  ahead.  Cloud transformation remained a high priority area for  enterprises in FY 2023, with greater focus on execution. They  engaged us to take up the modernization and migration of  their bigger, more complex workloads. The breadth and depth  of our cloud expertise, our scale, deep domain knowledge,  strong partnership credentials with the hyperscalers and our  portfolio of intellectual property on the cloud, give us a distinct  competitive edge in this phase of the cloud adoption cycle.  We also helped clients cope with the challenge of managing  cloud expenses. In some cases, it required rearchitecting  their application stack to be more cloud native, capable of  dynamically ramping up resource consumption during periods  of high demand, and automatic ramping down at other times.  Elsewhere, we offered our FinOps advisory and cloud managed  services to rein in cloud costs. The adoption of cloud technologies continues to drive  innovation within enterprises.

Newer developments like generative AI, large language models,  and quantum computing triggered more experimentation and  innovation by our clients. Our investments in research and  innovation across different industries, and our Pace innovation  architecture have positioned us well to partner with them in  these initiatives. Our Agile Innovation Cloud offering, where  we create dedicated, location-independent innovation teams  to help clients accelerate and scale up their innovation, gained  further traction in FY 2023. 7 new clients signed up during the  year, bringing the total to 30 clients.  Some of the emerging innovation themes that we helped  customers with include ecosystem and multi-industry models  underpinned by technologies like data marketplaces, API and  blockchain, in industries like transportation and public sector;  AI-powered autonomous robotics in the logistics industry, and  new applications for digital twins in the BFSI, Telecom and Retail  industries.  Within our growth and transformation (G&T) portfolio, business  model innovation continued to be a key theme. For example,  for a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility, we built the service  delivery platform central to their new business model of  providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement  services of various home appliances to households.  Ingram Micro , one of the largest technology distributors in  the US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot into  e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform from  a traditional distributor to a platform company that does  distribution.  Tapestry Inc , a leading New York-based house  of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands such as Coach, Kate  Spade, & Stuart Weitzman, partnered with TCS to drive their  omnichannel modernization and transform the customer  journey experience. Other G&T themes, such as M&A and sustainability continued to  bring in high-profile deal wins and new strategic engagements  for us in FY 2023. Elsewhere in this report, you can read about  the work we did for  Philips Domestic Appliances  in its journey  to be a standalone company, and how we helped  Eversource  Energy  pursue its carbon neutrality aspirations. Digital transformation, which began in the front office, towards  enhancing customer experience, made further inroads within  the enterprise during the year, unlocking tremendous value  in the middle and back office. As critical technologies such as  machine vision and conversational systems get better with  the use of AI, our Machine First™ approach is helping clients  use them innovatively in the back office, embedding them  into reimagined processes to drive greater velocity, agility,  throughput and resilience – which, among other things, also  enhances customer experience. The supplyside challenges of the last two years peaked in  the first half of FY 2023, with employee churn reaching  unprecedented levels. We broke out of the vicious cycle of hiring  and counter-hiring within the industry by investing in onboarding  an unprecedent number of fresh engineers – over  110,000  in  FY 2022 and over  44,000  in FY 2023 – and training them on the  technologies most in demand.  Newer developments like generative  AI, large language models, and  quantum computing triggered more  experimentation and innovation  by our clients. Our investments in  research and innovation across  different industries, and our Pace  innovation architecture have  positioned us well to partner with  them in these initiatives.  Applied at scale, across a broad set of business or IT  operations, this can result in an entirely new operating  model that significantly boosts our clients’ competitiveness.  As macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second half  of the year, we saw clients adapting by reprioritizing their  spends and showing greater interest in such operating model  transformations.  TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite,  has been a game changer, enabling faster transformations  that deliver concrete business benefits within months. Its 600  pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions enable plug  and play transformation of a range of business and technology  functions, horizontal and vertical. Nearly 300 of our clients have  used it to transform their business and IT operations.  In traditional outsourcing deals, we saw more multi-services  integrated deals. By consolidating multiple elements of the  operation stack – processes, applications, and the underlying  technology and infrastructure – with a single strategic partner,  clients not only achieve greater accountability, but also reduce  complexity and derisk their larger business transformations. The  same rationale is driving more vendor consolidation initiatives  that favor a few strategic partners with end-to-end service  offerings, the right innovation capabilities and scale. All these trends play to our strengths. Our scale, structure, and  ability to bring together different capabilities into a seamless  service delivery team, helped us win several large deals  throughout the year.

So when health-tech giant Royal  Philips sold Philips Domestic Appliances in 2021 to Hillhouse,  a private equity firm, the standalone company, rebranded as  Versuni, saw the separation as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity  to wipe the slate clean and transform into a digitally lean, agile,  and innovation-led organization.  Versuni partnered with TCS in its transformation journey from  strategy through execution, with a vision to embed insights and  agility into core processes, enabling shorter time to value and  quicker responses to market changes through a new cloud-first  application landscape. The program entailed decoupling the  company from the parent’s systems, while simultaneously  transforming it across all business domains, within an ambitious  2-year timeframe. The business transformation, enabled by SAP as the digital core,  establishes best practices-based processes from the consumer  products industry and simplified ways of working to drive speed,  agility and insights-led decision-making. TCS enabled Versuni’s strategies for driving revenue growth  opportunities and innovative product launches. The new  processes support Versuni’s journey to develop products made  with more sustainable materials, that are easier to repair,  refurbish, recycle, and help to reduce waste.  Enhancements were made to deliver superior business  outcomes across every function. Integrating supply chain  planning with factory scheduling will enable higher warehouse  productivity and more timely shipments. AI-powered insights  in finance will help improve cash flow, free up cash and drive  efficiencies in back-office functions. The new people processes  will provide a better employee experience and enable a more  responsive HR function. Partnering with TCS helped Versuni deploy a new digital  foundation and operate as an independent entity. The new fit- for-purpose stack enables Versuni to more effectively respond  to the fast-changing demands of the consumer products market,  and pursue its vision of turning houses into homes, and building  lifetime engagement with consumers.  I am really happy to have partnered with TCS in this  journey. TCS has been an invaluable partner in our  process and digital transformation journey with SAP as  the main enabling technology suite. The hard work and  dedication demonstrated by each member of the TCS  team has not gone unnoticed.

       " '40+ Energy utilities are leading the world’s energy transition,  investing in renewable energy sources as part of their journey  to carbon neutrality. Leaders in the sector are using technology  innovatively to draw environmentally conscious consumers  looking for greener choices, and grow their new clean energy  businesses.  Eversource Energy is a Fortune 500 energy company that  operates New England’s largest energy delivery system, with  4.4 million customers across Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts  (MA) and New Hampshire. It is focused on making its  operations carbon neutral by 2030, and bringing more  clean and affordable energy to New England. Eversource partnered with TCS to build a solution that  would help them on-board distributed solar power  capacity within its grid by purchasing power  from residential, industrial and commercial  customers who install solar panels and  storage on their properties, and enabling  them to avail of incentives offered by their  respective states, as part of state-level Net  Zero programs.  The TCS-built solution includes onboarding  of new solar customers, a customer  application that helps keep track of the units  generated, and a pricing engine that uses a  declining block pricing mechanism to  incentivize early enrolment as a producer. It  also includes a billing system that processes  recovery charges, solar credits and incentive  payments, and enables flexible payment  options as well as hardship relief options to  improve affordability and increase adoption of  energy efficiency programs. To facilitate quick roll outs across states, TCS  architected a reusable framework that would  simplify adoption of each state’s incentive program  into Eversource’s core platform, enabling the utility to  pursue a very aggressive implementation schedule for  each state. Using this solution, Eversource has been able to leverage  state incentives to make green energy affordable and rapidly  benefit nearly 430,000 customers in CT and MA so far, while  driving growth of its clean energy business. At the same time,  it is projected to produce over 9,700 MWh of solar power,  accelerating not only its own journey to carbon neutrality but  also that of the states it services.  Making green energy affordable is central to our business  strategy. Its technology enablement was a fairly complex  program with multiple sub-programs running concurrently.  TCS did an outstanding job in collaborating well with multiple  stakeholders and managing risks very well. The TCS team’s  contextual knowledge of the Eversource business and  technology landscape resulted in a high quality solution that  helped meet the regulatory mandate as well as Eversource’s  clean energy and energy affordability goals.

The most obvious areas are conversational systems,  content creation and digital marketing, and activities which  HV:  People often relate innovations to serendipitous discoveries.  We help clients structure and scale the innovation process using  the TCS Agile Innovation Cloud (AIC). This framework brings  together the best of TCS’ talent, research and innovation inputs,  global capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to scale up and  speed up ‘Ideas to Outcomes’. For an insurance major, we worked with the client’s teams  and collated actionable innovation ideas through a series of  brainstorming workshops using the Clay Map. Leveraging our  AIC, we rapidly built POCs every quarter, some of which got  turned into MVPs and rolled out across the enterprise. In just  eight months, dozens of innovation ideas were identified, and 24  progressed to become MVPs.  One reason for this high yield is that our teams leverage their  contextual knowledge, learned over years spent immersed in the  client’s IT and business landscape, to come up with ideas deeply  rooted in that organization’s reality and therefore more likely to  succeed.

In fact, this is the 50th anniversary of TCS’ very first  offshore development project, delivered using an in-house  code generator. In the 80s, our TRDDC  was famous for its  tools foundry, which could generate custom code translators  on demand, converting source code from any programming  language to any other language. TCS MasterCraft™ is today used by hundreds of our clients  for developing, transforming and maintaining model-based  applications. In fact, our award-winning product suite, TCS  BaNCS™, is written and maintained using MasterCraft. Even  though there is effort involved in defining the model up-front,  clients see significant productivity benefits.  The new low code, no code platforms have done away even  with those overheads. Their graphical drag and drop user  interface empowers people with no coding knowledge to build  sophisticated applications very quickly.  And yet, none of this has led to any demand compression. It has  only led to more growth. We believe generative AI will be no  different. Like prior breakthrough technologies, it will sharply  bring down the effort per function point, driving up programmer  productivity immensely. This will result in greater consumption,  with volume growth more than making up for the effort  deflation.',\n",

Every new generation of  technology has led to reduction in programming effort per  function point. But while that has steadily fallen, aggregate  spending on IT services has only risen year after year, over  decades. Take for example, the switch from assembly language to C.  Its compilers came with large, extensible libraries of reusable  pre-defined procedures. A developer could invoke a procedure  with one line of code in C and embed its entire logic in the code  base, without actually coding all of it from scratch. Three lines  of C accomplished what took 30 lines in assembly language. The  10x effort deflation didn’t result in mass layoffs of programmers.  Instead, there was an explosion in software development  because the same IT team could now build ten times as many  function points.  Similarly, enterprises adopted offshore outsourcing, it led to a  big cost deflation, but nobody’s IT budgets deflated. Instead,  those savings went into building new systems and volumes rose  to fill budgets and spending on IT services has only expanded.  Likewise with low-code, no-code platforms.',\n",
       " 'Computing Futures KAK:  With most goods and services, when the price falls, any  increase in volume is limited by how much of that good or  service the market can consume in a defined period. When farm  mechanization reduced the cost of tilling, the increased demand  for men in tractors was not large enough to compensate for the  effort deflation because there was only so much land available  to till.  Demand for IT services behaves differently. In every enterprise,  there is significant unmet demand. Every CIO has limited  capacity for new system development, resulting in a requirement  backlog that never gets fulfilled. Technologies like generative  AI or low code-no code can help a CIO expand capacity and  accomplish much more with the same budget. But even then,  the backlog never goes away because there is no limit on  business users’ ingenuity or competitive drive. Demand just rises  to fill the incremental capacity created by new technologies.  HV:   The emergence of new technologies triggers more ideas,  experimentation and more demand for our services. To that  extent, business application of generative AI, along with other  technologies, will itself drive the incremental demand that fills  up the capacity it frees up through higher productivity. platform launched in 2009, with shared services bundled in,  went on to make us the market leader in life and pensions  administration in the UK.  Historically, gaining leadership in IT services on any new  technology required just training sufficient numbers of  people in that technology, ahead of market demand. In the  last decade, we not only did that at scale on the entire class  of digital technologies, but also invested in higher order  capabilities so we could advise our clients on how best to  harness the combinatorial power of new technologies in their  specific business context.  We scaled up our Research and Innovation, exploring use cases  across different industries, creating solutions and showcasing  them at our innovation centers. We expanded COIN, created  new innovation frameworks and set up Pace Ports, our               co-innovation hubs, across the world. Today, we not only  have a large number of patents, but also the largest portfolio  of products and platforms in our peer set, helping win large  transformational engagements that uniquely distinguish us. We are helping clients explore and develop end-to-end  scenarios in combining technologies like quantum computing,  generative AI, 5G and the emerging 6G, and new concepts in  cyber security.  Here in India, we have stitched together a fully  indigenous network stack for 4G and 5G, a unique achievement  that differentiates us from our global peers.  Elsewhere, we are pursuing 5G-enabled opportunities in  operational technologies such as autonomous machines and  remote operations. We are looking at emerging cross-industry  ecosystem business models in sustainability and energy  transition, which will be the big drivers of growth in the coming  years.  HV:  On the cloud, the biggest technology trend in recent years,  we were one of the earliest to set up dedicated business units  for each of the three leading hyperscaler clouds. Our early  investments in building deep expertise and a large portfolio  of innovative cloud-native solutions helped us capture  tremendous growth and gain share.  We are today one of the largest partners – in some cases,  the  largest partner – to each of those providers, in terms of  number of employees with certifications, volumes of workloads  migrated to the cloud and in number of solutions and  intellectual property on their platforms.

If all this isn’t  leadership, what is? Innovate, Adapt, Thrive: A Fireside Chat  |  29 Revolutionizing  Small Value Payments in South Africa BankservAfrica, Africa’s leading automated clearing house,  has been facilitating payments in South Africa and the region,  for over five decades through its seamless interbank clearing  and settlement services. It has a track record of pioneering  innovations like the SASWITCH, a national network of  interoperable ATMs, in the mid-80s.  When the South African Reserve Bank unveiled its Vision  2025 strategy to reform the South African national payment  system framework, BankservAfrica took the lead along with its  ecosystem partners, and engaged TCS to build a new platform  for rapid payments that would usher in the era of modern,  cost-effective, instant digital payments on the continent. TCS designed a high availability, containerized, cloud optimized  solution with TCS BaNCS for Market Infrastructure at its core,  using high performance microservices for clearing and payment.  Hosted on a public cloud, the solution is very resilient and can  auto-scale.  On the front-end, users can make a payment, or a request  for payment, through a payment service called PayShap,  formally launched in March 2023. Very conveniently, users  don’t need to enter the recipient’s bank account or branch  code details to make payments. Instead, they can use a  unique identifier such as the recipient’s mobile number, or  a bank-generated identification number, which serves as                                                                                                    a proxy for the full banking details. This proxy and resolution  is enabled through a tamper-proof blockchain-based solution  powered by TCS’ Quartz Smart Solution.  By democratizing access to a frictionless system for low value  payments, TCS’ innovative solution for BankservAfrica has the  potential to reduce the use of cash for small transactions and  accelerate formalization of the unorganized sector. It will drive  new fee-based revenues for banks, and also offer customer  insights with which they can offer credit to more consumers.  This will not only improve financial inclusion, but also add to  South Africa’s GDP growth – a fitting outcome for two very  purpose-driven organizations that came together to build this  platform of national importance. BankservAfrica views cost-effective digital payments as a  pathway to improving credit access and financial inclusion in  South Africa. After an extensive evaluation, we selected TCS for  their deep understanding of the payments ecosystem, global  experience, technological expertise, intellectual property  and shared values. The outcome has been very gratifying. By  changing consumer behaviors, PayShap has the potential to  reshape sectors and transform the South African economy.

       " 'Digital Sciences Founded by a master builder  (toryo)  more than  400 years ago, Takenaka Corporation has  specialized in building construction with an  integrated design-build approach that includes  initial planning and aftercare services like  maintenance. It has redefined urban landscapes  in Japan and around the world, with famous  landmarks like Tokyo Tower and Changi International  Airport. At the core of its longstanding business success  is its passion for innovation rooted in its  toryo  spirit,  quality management, and its commitment to realizing a  sustainable society.      Takenaka’s Vision for 2030 aims to realize a fourth industrial  revolution in the building industry by embracing digital  transformation across the construction value chain.  It is  addressing key problems facing the industry in Japan, such  as labor shortage, by using digital technologies to increase  employee productivity and improve the work-life balance of  employees. Its innovation initiatives include AI-based design  and construction planning, next-generation work sites with  construction robots and remotely operated cranes, and  environmentally conscious smart buildings with  intelligent controls using IoT. The foundation for this  innovation is the Building 4.0 TM  digital platform, which  is being developed and operated in partnership with TCS.  Building 4.0 TM  will integrate data from sales, design, estimation,  engineering, construction management, facilities management  services, human resources and accounting. This will enable  superior decision-making across a wide range of operations  through advanced analysis using machine learning and AI.  In building design, for example, structural engineers can use  AI-based cross-section estimations to more efficiently implement  optimal structural designs. In construction, it can enable better  construction planning using accurate forecasts of materials and  personnel required to achieve target schedules, improve visibility  of project progress, and enhance labor productivity. TCS is supporting Takenaka in promoting innovation, building  construction digital twins, simulating human behavior, utilizing  knowledge of the construction field, and exploring “what-if”  scenarios. The knowledge gained from these efforts will help  Takenaka develop comprehensive and sustainable solutions  through better designs, understand project risks, and improve  KPIs for quality, cost, schedule, safety, and the environment. Through Building 4.0 TM , Takenaka will continue to create  new value for society and customers while improving  business efficiency. It will also contribute to the realization  of a sustainable society enabling new architecture and urban  creation services that is in harmony with the environment and  local communities. We selected TCS for supporting our digital transformation not only  because of its accumulated global knowledge and technological  capabilities, but also because throughout the long histories of both  companies, there is a common bond in our corporate cultures of  valuing stakeholders, including society and customers as well as  employees. Building 4.0 will turn the dreams of our stakeholders  into reality, and we would like to develop it as a foundation to  connect with a sustainable society of the future. Keizo Iwashita                                                                                      General Manager of Digital Division & Executive Officer Takenaka Corporation Customer Stories  |  31 ML :  One swallow does not a summer make. This unprecedented  event at TCS is just a reminder that CEOs are human too,  and might want to pursue their dreams and aspirations just  like anybody else. As for our track record in retaining senior  leadership talent, it remains industry-leading.  I am proud to say that almost the entire team of 25 business  heads we had created in 2008 is still in TCS. We have over  125,000  TCSers today with an average tenure of over 10 years  in TCS. This cohort represents the true strength of TCS. They  are the custodians of our culture, values and institutional  memory, and have been central to our ability to weather the  unprecedented attrition and influx of fresh talent without letting  it affect the high quality of project outcomes that our clients  have come to expect from TCS. We not only retained our leadership talent better, but also  expanded the leadership pool six-fold in the last five years by  incubating a next generation of leaders running sub-ISUs, with  P&L responsibilities. The breadth and depth of our leadership  bench today makes our succession planning an industry  benchmark, with multiple equally-qualified successors for any  leadership position, starting from the CEO down, as you recently  witnessed. SS :  Normalizing attrition is definitely a relief, but I wouldn’t call it  a tailwind. We incurred a  1.4%  margin headwind in FY 2023 from  backfilling and retention expenses. If we onboarded a lateral hire  at a 20% premium during the year, that increase in employee  cost is a recurring one. But yes, hopefuly we won’t have any new  headwind due to attrition in FY 2024.  Also, with the supplyside challenges easing, incremental  cost of hiring laterals should be lower, and it also gives us an  opportunity to bring down subcontractor expense. That is one  important margin lever for FY 2024. Utilization improvement,  flatter employee pyramid and hopefully, currency support, are  the other levers. On the other hand, we will have our usual wage  increase in Q1 and we should see further increases in travel  expenses during the year. SS :  It is not true that large outsourcing deals are necessarily  margin dilutive. A few high profile mega-deals in the industry  whose low quality revenues impacted margins have resulted in  that perception. In the last five years, TCS has won several mega  deals with TCV over $500 million, and every year we win dozens  of large deals, with TCV over $50 million. And yet, during this  period, our EBIT margin has remained in a tight band between  24 and 26 percent. Profitability of large deals depends on how you construct  them. A client might push for a certain amount of absolute cost  reduction at the time of contract renewal. The service provider  can either drop prices and sacrifice margins to deliver those ',\n",
       " 'Sustainability Q&A  with CFO',\n",
       " 'MasterCraft CHRO Q&A   |  32 ML :  Yes, this is another unusual, industry-wide problem.  The pay disparities will eventually go away for two reasons.  SS :  In the short term, higher onsite wage inflation is a headwind  because our legacy contracts have much lower cost of living  adjustments written in. But in the medium and longer term, this  will get adjusted.  Wage inflation affects everybody in the market including the  clients themselves. Newer contracts reflect the changed cost  structure for onsite effort. Also, contractual terms now peg  annual cost of living increases to prevailing inflation rates.  That  should help mitigate inflation risks in longer term contracts. SS :  Inflation differential is not the only driver of currency  depreciation. Rupee is also affected by India’s trade deficit,  interest rate differentials and capital movements. But for  argument’s sake, let us assume that we may not have the benefit  of currency depreciation in the future. Now remember, the  currency depreciation basically helps us offset wage inflation  in India which historically, we never passed on to clients. In  the changed circumstances, this too will get baked into new  contracts the same way onsite wage inflation has been. So in the  longer term, we should be able to sustain our current margins. ML :  In my view, the productivity benefits will get baked into  clients’ expectations around project velocity and throughput.  For a given project team size, clients will expect much higher  output at a much faster pace, compared to today. On aggregate,  as the unit price of a function point falls, we expect volumes to  increase. With ever-increasing dependence on technology for  competitive differentiation, we expect enterprise spending to  keep growing, for which we will have to keep hiring new talent.  So the linearity between revenue and headcount is not going  away any time soon. SS :  Margins are a measure of relative competitiveness. Based  just on the productivity improvements in code generation  using generative AI, it is difficult to see how a technology which  is freely available to everyone – service providers as well as  clients’ IT teams – can change relative competitiveness and by  extension, margins. Margin improvement is possible from selling  higher-priced growth and transformation solutions which use  generative AI. Likewise, new software products or platforms  which use generative AI to deliver superior business outcomes. ',\n",
       " 'ADD ML :  Work from home is definitely more convenient for  everybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who  are well networked within the organization can work effectively  and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up  over the years. That isn’t the case with more junior employees.  Workplace essentials like collaboration, mentorship and team- building suffered a lot in these two years.  Then there is the matter of organizational culture. Over half our  workforce today was hired after March 2020. New employees  get acculturated through physical interactions with senior  colleagues and leaders, by observing and following their  behaviors and ways of thinking. Without those interactions,  employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly  impacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people  to our offices during the year.',\n",
       " 'TM ML :  Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or  lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be  other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home  during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for  some women, keeping them from returning to office even after  everything normalized.  The higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our  efforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down  on it. Focused leadership development programs like iExcel  are driving tremendous change. Of all the leadership positions  fulfilled with internal candidates in FY 2023, women made up  23%  of the selected candidates, even though they account for  only  14%  of the applicant pool. This speaks well of the quality  of the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as  the supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting  diversity. Likewise, in our external hiring, women make up  38.1%  of our net hires this year, versus  35.7%  in our workforce. ',\n",
       " 'Customers savings, or propose a completely different operating model  that uses lesser effort, protects or even expands margins, and  achieves the client’s objectives.  TCS has differentiated itself in this space with the latter  approach. Its win-win propositions reimagine the customer’s  operating model, leveraging AI and machine learning to reduce  human intervention while improving process velocity and  operational resilience. Customers have really taken to this idea.  In FY 2023, we signed 29 large operating model transformation  deals, covering business as well as IT operations, compared to 18  in the prior year.  One, we are running a program called Elevate that empowers  employees to take control of their careers and pursue their  aspirations by achieving certain learning goals. Meeting  those goals can result in significant pay increases, perhaps  even a doubling of salary. Second, there will be a natural  time-correction through performance-linked wage increases,  promotions and voluntary attrition. Q&A   |  33 Innovating to  Improve Crop Yields and Farmer Incomes With climate change, agriculture is increasingly vulnerable  to extreme weather events, inconsistent rainfall, as well as  increased pest and disease outbreaks. This affects crop yields,  farmer incomes and food security.   To help address these challenges, TCS built a digital platform  to empower the Indian farmer and improve the resilience of  the nation’s farming sector. The TCS Digital Platform for Next  Generation Agriculture (DNA) is a state-of-the-art, cloud-based  decision intelligence and crop monitoring system that provides  customized, site-specific predictive advisory services to farmers  and other players in the food value chain. TCS DNA uses an innovative `Sky-Earth’ convergence, intelligently  fusing remote-sensing data from earth observation satellites and  drones with data from proximal sensors and handheld devices  on the field. This gives scale and reduces cost significantly  without sacrificing accuracy. Proprietary AI/ML algorithms are  utilized to analyze the data and provide reliable information and  predictive intelligence on weather, soil condition, crop health,  and pest forecasts. Farmers can use these insights to make  quicker and more informed decisions, optimize production costs  and improve their yield.  Rallis India Ltd, a leading agri-input company, partnered with TCS  for the first field deployment of the new platform, to improve  the productivity of its hybrid seed production farms, as well as  for internal business planning. Branded Drishti (“Vision”), the  platform is used to monitor approximately 130 million hectares  of agricultural land across India, for various aspects such as  crop productivity, soil moisture, early alerts for pest outbreak,  as well as seasonal weather anomalies and extreme weather  events. The platform has helped Rallis increase the field scouting  efficiency of its hybrid seed production team, and improved  yield by 1 to 2%. TCS DNA is also helping Amalgamation Plantations, the second  largest producer of tea in India, improve the quality and  sustainability of tea leaves procured from small tea growers.  It is being used to remotely monitor various aspects of small  plantations using satellite imagery, predict pest and disease  and improve quality. This is expected to help small tea growers  improve their income by 15% and reduce rejections by 20%. Our partnership with TCS is helping us alleviate  the issues of farmers and agriculture. The Drishti  platform identifies problem areas and offers  actionable insights to farmers in India, leading to  effective crop management by reducing the risks  and minimizing the loss in yield.

If the delayed decision-making and cash  conservation seen in some segments at the end of FY 2023  flows over into the first half of FY 2024, that could result in some  moderation in full year revenue growth after two years of strong  growth. Key demand drivers expected to power the company’s growth in  FY 2024 include: •  Technology transformation:  IT infrastructure  modernization, cloud enablement, application and data  estate modernization, cloud migration, data centre and  collocated data support, digital workplace, digital twins,  cyber security, ERP modernization, low-code no-code, 5G/ Edge and AI adoption. 8   IMF World Economic Outlook Update, April 2023 Management Discussion and Analysis   |  95 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 •  G&T:  Customer experience transformation using  personalization, omnichannel implementation, immersive  experiences using XR/Metaverse, product and business  model innovation, supply chain modernization, M&A  integration / divestitures, sustainability. •  Operations:  Traditional outsourcing, vendor consolidation  and multi-services deals, AI/ML-led transformation of IT  / business operations for greater resilience and leaner  operating models, managed services models and real time  operation visibility. Enterprise Risk Management 9 FY 2023 saw multiple external and internal challenges continuing  to shape the overall risk profile of the company. Macroeconomic  and geo-political risks had an impact throughout the year.  The Russia-Ukraine war and geo-political tensions, trade wars  and imposed sanctions were pervasive and had direct and  cascading impacts on economies and businesses. Shortages,  rising inflation, supply-chain disruptions, energy crisis led to  further uncertainties in the economic growth environment,  with the year ending with banking industry upheavals in US and  Europe. During the year, IT organizations including TCS faced the  knock-on effects of the pandemic including attrition and impact  of hybrid modes of working. Technological advancements and  breakthroughs like generative AI and metaverse have opened up  new vistas of both risks and opportunities. TCS continues to monitor this uncertain and dynamic business  environment very closely and has strengthened the deployment  of its Enterprise Risk Management framework to address  the risks and leverage the associated opportunities. This  framework enables risk identification, risk assessment, risk  response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk  governance. Key risk indicators and control indicators are used  to anticipate risks and assess effectiveness of their mitigation  actions respectively. TCS takes a holistic view of its enterprise risk profile, covering  strategic, operational, compliance, financial and catastrophic  risks, thus enabling informed decision-making. Risks are  assessed and managed at various levels with a top-down and  bottom-up approach across the enterprise, business units,  geographies, business functions, customer relationships and  individual projects. Listed below are some of the key risks, anticipated impact on the company and mitigation strategies.',\n",

The Internal Control – Integrated Framework  (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency  and accountability in an organization’s process of designing  and implementing a system of internal control. The framework  requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage  appropriate responses. The company has successfully laid down  the framework and ensured its effectiveness. TCS’ internal controls are commensurate with its size and the  nature of its operations. These have been designed to provide  reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing  reliable financial and operational information, complying with  applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use,  executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring  compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-defined  delegation of power with authority limits for approving contracts  as well as expenditure. Processes for formulating and reviewing  annual and long-term business plans have been laid down.  TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP)  system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data  for accounting, consolidation and management information  purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all its processes  and controls with global best practices. TCS management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s  internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Regulation  17 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)  Regulations, 2015  (SEBI LODR) as of March 31, 2023. B S R & Co.

TCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP (PwC) LLP to oversee and carry out internal audit of its activities. The  audit is based on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each  year in consultation with the statutory auditors and approved  by the Audit Committee. In line with international practice,  the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the review of  internal controls and risks in the company’s operations such  as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement,  employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes, including  the subsidiaries and foreign branches. TCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialized third party  consultants and professionals for business specific compliances  such as quality management, service management, information  security, etc. The Audit Committee reviews reports submitted  by the management and audit reports submitted by internal  auditors and statutory auditors. Suggestions for improvement  are considered and the audit committee follows up on corrective  action. The audit committee also meets TCS’ statutory auditors  to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the adequacy of internal  control systems and keeps the board of directors informed of its  major observations periodically. Based on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of Companies  Act 2013 and Regulation 18 of SEBI LODR), TCS’ Audit Committee  has concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, the company’s  internal financial controls were adequate and operating  effectively.

Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent  directors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent. None of the independent directors is related to each other,  or to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years. Board effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds  directorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as  an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities. TCS’ governance philosophy around minority shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC  which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse  and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected. TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures  and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and  material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured  global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the  management or the Board. Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office  through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’  Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints. Avoidance of conflict of  interest 3 Chairmanship 4  of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief  Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD). TCoC 5  for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses  covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any   employee – including the executive directors – from accepting any position of responsibility,  with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval.  For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board. Values, Ethics and compliance 6 Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and  has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global  business. The Company’s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual,  Excellence, and Learning and Sharing. The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate  citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights,  prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and  avoidance of conflicts of interest. Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based  annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further,  frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the company values  and the TCoC. Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through  inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts. Employees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical  behaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company,  which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other  stakeholders can also report any non  - compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by  senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower  Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to  employees as part of the mandatory training modules. 3  GRI 2-15 4  GRI 2-11 5    https://www.tcs.com/tata-code-of-conduct 6  GRI 2-12 Corporate Governance Report   |  115 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23',\n",

Tax Strategy 7 TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to the  respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner.

TCS’s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where  available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the  tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a  robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing  the tax risk.

Succession  planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior  management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key  functions within their units. Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board.

They have  roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. Currently, 36 TCS offices, with over 23.68 million sq. ft  of office area, are certified green buildings by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). These make up over 64.6% of TCS’ total real  estate portfolio in India.   During the year, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT  infrastructure. Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply  (UPS), LEDs, motors, and chillers.    •  HVAC system upgradation included deployment of energy efficient fans for Air handling units (AHUs), Variable Refrigerant  Flow (VRF) systems for 24X7 on variable load, oilless centrifugal chillers like magnetic or ceramic bearing chillers and chiller  plant manager.    •  Energy efficient UPS included Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) based UPS with high efficiency and modular UPS.   •  Other energy efficiency initiatives included LED lighting with advanced controls, EFF1/IE3 rated high efficiency motors, 11KV  power distribution from sub-station to different buildings, use of 11 kV centrifugal chillers and elevators with energy efficient  and gearless motors.  81   There are some inclusions and modifications in estimating carbon emissions during FY 2023 when compared to FY 2022.       Scope 2 emissions:  The emission factors for the grid electricity across various geographies have been taken primarily from IEA v5-IEA 2022  (12/2022) database except for US, Canada, Australia, and India where emission factors are available from regional sources. For India geography,  the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), user guide 18.0, Dec 2022 emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh (carbon emission factor of grid  electricity, including RE) has been considered for estimating the carbon emissions from procured electricity in FY 2023. Over the years CEA has  been publishing the weighted average carbon emission factor (conventional) of the grid which was being used by TCS for Scope 2 emissions  until FY 2022 as emission factors (including RE) was not available earlier. However, in Dec 2022, CEA published the carbon emission factor of  grid electricity (including RE) for the first time for years 2013-14 to 2021-22. As TCS procures electricity from the India grid, which is mix of  conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh is considered more appropriate. 82   Corrected Scope 1 emissions data for FY 2022 due to minor changes in fuel consumption data.  83   GRI 305-5, TC-SI-130a.3.

Until FY 2022, TCS used the DEFRA 2012, spend based emission factors, which are outdated. In view of adopting  updated emission factors, there was a reduction in category 1 by 89% and category 2 by 82%.  •    Category 3:  The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned  vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category in  FY 2023. Earlier in FY 2022, only WTT of electricity procured was considered. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 3.5% of the total  emissions under category 3. •    Category 4:  Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to  other supplies. In FY 2023, TCS has also included emissions related to non-IT supplies and waste disposal. The supplies include cafeteria/ canteen  supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material and other stationary supplies and disposal of wastes (e-wastes, hazardous  wastes, batteries etc.,). Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. The increase in  scope of reporting contributes to 31% of the total emissions under category 4. •    Category 5:  No change in approach in FY 2023. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of  waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2022.  •    Category 6:  In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at  various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022. The increase in scope of reporting contributes  to 0.5% of the total emissions under category 6. •   Category 7:  In FY 2023, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees  (global), personal employee commute (only India), public employee commute (only India) and work from home (WFH) emissions (global). In pre- pandemic period, TCS had considered and included private and public commute of India employees in carbon emissions, however during FY 2021  and FY 2022, this was insignificant to be included under this category.

This is  delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile  delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in  software development.

       " '27.9   These consolidated financial statements have been  prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial  instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured  at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting  period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of  the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date. All  assets and liabilities have been classified as current and  non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle.  Based on the nature of services rendered to customers  and time elapsed between deployment of resources  and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the  consideration for such services rendered, the Group has  considered an operating cycle of 12 months.   The statement of cash flows has been prepared under  indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals  or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or  payments and items of income or expense associated  with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows  from operating, investing and financing activities of the  Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid  investments that are readily convertible to known amounts  of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in  value to be cash equivalents.   The functional currency of the Company and its Indian  subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee ( ` ). The functional currency  of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary  economic environment in which the entity operates.  Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange  rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign  currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the  balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising  on settlement and restatement are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and  liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in  foreign currencies are not retranslated.   The significant accounting policies used in preparation of  the consolidated financial statements have been discussed  in the respective notes.',\n",
       " 'TCS’ Business   The Company consolidates all entities which are controlled  by it.   The Company establishes control when; it has power over  the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns  from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to  affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant  activities of the entity.   Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from  the date control commences until the date control ceases.   The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year  are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and  up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.   The financial statements of the Group companies are  consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company  transactions, balances, income and expenses are  eliminated in full on consolidation.   Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do  not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity  transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s  interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted  to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the  subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which  the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value  of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly  in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.   Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency  other than the functional currency of the Company have  been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the  balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such  entities has been translated using weighted average  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  197 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been  reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the  statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation  is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control,  significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative  amount of exchange differences related to that foreign  operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of  profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.',\n",

Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value  of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.

The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially  measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling  interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable  net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an  acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition,  the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the  amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the  non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in  equity of subsidiaries.   Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in  entities that are under common control are accounted at  historical cost.

Such amounts are reclassified  into the statement of profit and loss when the related  hedged items affect profit and loss.     Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no  longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or  loss recognised in other comprehensive income and  accumulated in equity till that time remains and is  recognised in statement of profit and loss when the  forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and  loss.

The right-of-use asset is  subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted  for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the  commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use  assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment  whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.   The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement  date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily  determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably  similar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease  or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease  payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate  the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease  liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any  reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount  of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit  and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero  and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re- measurement in statement of profit and loss.   The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease  term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
