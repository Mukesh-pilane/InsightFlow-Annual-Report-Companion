The ESHS team comprises of environmental sustainability professionals who monitor various climate change related data points including emissions and support the implementation of emission reduction initiatives across TCS locations in collaboration with action owners within the organization. Location level targets are monitored by the location level operations and ESHS teams.  •  F or environmental risk assessment, mitigation, and adaptation, TCS has a well-defined structure with an Enterprise Risk  Management Unit which is headed by a Chief Risk Officer. This unit reviews all risks associated with the company operations. ERM categorizes risks and opportunities into Strategic, Operational, Financial, Compliance and Catastrophic.  •  The risk iden tification process is carried out for the entire organization and its value chain to assess all risks including the physical,  compliance, operational and reputational risks due to climate change and the business opportunities associated with it. Unit level risk assessments are done to assess the physical risks of climate change. These are then rolled up to the enterprise-level risk portfolio register and suitably included. These risks are reviewed on a half yearly basis or as required.  •  As T CS’ customers respond to climate change actions, the company is seeing opportunities to provide technology-led solutions  to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Recent events have accelerated digital adoption, put the spotlight on supply chain resilience and added urgency to the sustainability imperative. TCS leveraged its deep expertise in IoT, advanced analytics,  4 T CFD Governance A and B 5  GRI 2-13 Sustainability Disclosures  |  334 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23and machine learning to come up with a suite of offerings in this space, including intellectual property such as Clever Energy™,  IP2™, and TCS Envirozone™. Clients across industries such as retail, manufacturing, utilities and consumer goods are engaging the company to develop innovative technology led solutions to reduce energy consumption, or to measure and track green-house gas emissions across their end-to-end supply chain, reduce their carbon footprint, reduce waste and promote recycling. Strategy  6 A) Describe the clima te-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. Current regulation TCS is required to follow all the environmental regulations around emissions, water discharge, waste recycling  etc. Compliance to these regulations is monitored as part of the company’s risk management function and integrated into its mitigation plans. TCS discloses its performance against various environmental parameters as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework, which is a part of this Integrated Annual Report. Emerging regulation Emerging regulations including carbon taxes (coal or fossil fuel taxes leading to escalation in the electricity  tariff), mandatory energy audits are examples which impact TCS. Regulations around procurement of renewable energy, which is a key driver of the company’s climate change mitigation plan, is also ever evolving in all major geographies. TCS keeps a close watch on the emerging regulations and plans its organizational sustainability strategy and roadmap to adapt to those changes. Technology With more energy efficient and eco-friendly building and IT equipment coming in the market, keeping TCS  offices eco-efficient is an ongoing process wherein the company evaluates the technology and suitability and works on a phaseout plan to move to the new more efficient technology. These are considered as operational risks and opportunities which drive the company to make its infrastructure more climate resilient. Additionally, TCS is one of the market leaders in the cloud migration opportunity, helping clients migrate their workloads from owned data centers to hyperscaler clouds, significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated with those workloads. Legal TCS tracks environmental legal compliance (air emissions, water discharges, waste management and others) on a periodic basis and has a robust internal compliance management system to identify and comply with all legal requirements of current, amended and new regulations.  Market Climate change is driving a lot of changes in TCS’ customer behaviour, thus creating new markets and new opportunities, giving the company an opportunity to partner with them in their climate change mitigation journey by providing solutions, services, and process automation which helps in emission reduction. Reputation Reputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasingly  aware of climate change related issues. It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to maintain TCS’ reputation.  Acute physical Acute physical risks associated with extreme weather events is relevant as TCS has substantial operations in  coastal cities in India which are exposed to potential extreme weather events like heavy precipitation, flood, and cyclones. E.g., The company offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, Kochi are exposed to physical risks from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place.  Chronic physical Having presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic physical impacts like change in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, with TCS’s presence in coastal cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Kochi, Trivandrum, Kolkata, rise in sea level and related impacts like land submergence, salt water intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems are more likely. These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure. 6  T CFD Strategy A, B and C. The time horizon considered by TCS during the current year for its assessment of short, medium and  long term are 0 to 5 years, 5 to 10 years and 10 to 20 years respectively. Sustainability Disclosures  |  335 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23B) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced the organization business, strategy and  financial planning.  Ha ve climate-related  risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?Description of influence Products and servicesYes As TCS’ customers respond to climate change actions, the company is seeing opportunities to provide technology-led solutions to help them achieve their sustainability goals. The change in technology consumption reflects the prevailing trends in the economy. Recent events have accelerated digital adoption, put the spotlight on supply chain resilience and added urgency to the sustainability imperative.  Each of these represents an opportunity that can contribute towards the growth of  not just as one company, but of the ecosystem as a whole. TCS leveraged its deep expertise in IoT, advanced analytics, and machine learning to come up with a suite of offerings in this space, including intellectual property such as Clever Energy™, IP2™, and TCS Envirozone™. Clients across industries such as retail, manufacturing, utilities and consumer goods  are engaging TCS to develop innovative technology led solutions to reduce energy consumption, or to measure and track green-house gas emissions across their end-to-end supply chain, reduce their carbon footprint, reduce waste and promote recycling. Supply chain and/or value chainYes Supply Chain sustainability through responsible sourcing is one of the risk mitigations identified by the Company under its sustainability risk. TCS’s Green Procurement policy outlines its commitment to making its supply chain more responsible and sustainable. Energy efficiency is one of the major procurement considerations in all the company’s IT and other infrastructure assets procurement as this is directly correlated with TCS’ emission profile.  Climate related risks play a very important role in the company’s supply chain  engagements, and TCS is working with its suppliers to bring in improvements in carbon performance along with other ESG elements. Investment in R&D Yes TCS’ investments in research and innovation have resulted in solutions like Envirozone™, Clever Energy and IP2™. TCS has been using Clever Energy for the last few years to reduce its energy consumption and is now offering these to clients to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Additionally, TCS has been investing in building green campuses (IGBC certified).  Operations Yes Climate Change risks play an important consideration in TCS’ operations. The company has created an environmentally sustainable approach by creating green policies, processes, frameworks, and infrastructure. TCS’ campuses are designed to withstand extreme weather events and the business continuity plans are tested periodically to ensure continued operations without any disruption. Green buildings, efficient operations, green IT, the use of renewable energy to reduce carbon footprint; adoption of newer technologies and methods to manage waste in line with circular economy principles are integral to the company operations. All these initiatives are helping TCS achieve its Net Zero target by 2030. Sustainability Disclosures  |  336 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Ha ve climate-related  risks and opportunities  influenced your strategy in this area?Description of influence Direct costs, Capital expenditures, Capital allocation, AssetsYes TCS has aligned its current systems of internal financial control with the requirement of Companies Act 2013, on the lines of the globally accepted risk-based framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.  The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to  increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The company has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness. Climate risks and opportunities are the key factors while making financial  considerations especially while making investments in offices, equipment, and renewable energy. Investment in these areas constitutes a substantial share of the company’s overall capital investment. Major investments are in green buildings, roof top solar and other energy efficiency initiatives. In FY 2023 TCS has invested ₹3,063 crore in projects to improve environmental and social impacts. These investments, along with other mitigation steps, helped the company reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 71% from base year 2016. These initiatives also help the company to position itself as a leader in the climate domain contributing to TCS’ market value. C) Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario Climate related  scenarioParameters, assumptions, analytical choices Transition scenarios IEA B2DSThe climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included a) nature loss and ecological degradation, b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation, c) changing customer and workforce preferences, d) the rise of extreme weather, e) increasing regulations, pricing and disclosure of externalities, f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and g) rising incomes. Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across value  chain and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value drivers analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain  including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition). In the transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approach has been selected as its more conservative scenario. The inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand. Changing customer behavior and carbon costs are assessed as a transition risk to TCS with a growing number  of jurisdictions at regional and national level planning to implement a carbon tax or emission trading scheme.

Detailed analysis was conducted on a) material climate change physical risks and opportunities across  value chain, and b)assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value drivers’ analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) & c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition). The physical risk is assessed using the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 8.5 scenario takes a global warming between  3-4 degrees above pre-industrial levels which is a conservative scenario and helps us understand the worst-case climate impacts on our operations. Inputs for the assessment included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Government of India plan on energy  efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand. Few strategies to mitigate physical risks of climate change include -1) A robust Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to respond to climate events.2) Investments in climate resilient infrastructure (for cyclone, floods).

Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did   not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information included in the Report, and accordingly ,  we do not express a conclusion on this information .    Criteria applied by Tata Consultancy Services Limited   In preparing the integrated  report, Tata Consultancy Services Limited  applied , The International  Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC framework), and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.  GRI  Standards were specifically designed for  the Integrated Annual R eport  FY 2 3; As a result, the subject  matter information may not be suitable for another purpose .    TCS’s responsibilities    Tata Consultancy Services Limited management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for  presenting the integrated report in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. This  responsibility includes  establishing and maintaining internal contr ols, maintaining adequate records, and  making estimates relevant to the preparation of the subject matter , such that  it is free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.     EY’s responsibilities     Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matter based on the  evidence  we have obtained.    We conducted our engagement in accordance with  the International Standard for  Assurance  Engagements  Other Than Audits or Revie ws of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’), and  the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with Tata Consultancy Services Limited . Those  standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance  about  whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with  the Criteria, and  to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment,  including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due  to fraud or error.     We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited   assurance  conclusions.

Does the en tity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details83.  Y es. TCS had set a target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% by 2025 and become net zero by 2030.  The first part was achieved in FY 2023 through a combination of green infrastructure, green IT, energy efficiency and renewable  energy.   Commitmen t to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  In June 2022, T CS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero  through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking action - Science Based Targets. TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets for validation by SBTi.  Gr een Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:  All ne w campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have  roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. Currently, 36 TCS offices, with over 23.68 million sq. ft of office area, are certified green buildings by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). These make up over 64.6% of TCS’ total real estate portfolio in India.  During the y ear, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT  infrastructure. Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), LEDs, motors, and chillers.   •  HV AC system upgradation included deployment of energy efficient fans for Air handling units (AHUs), Variable Refrigerant  Flow (VRF) systems for 24X7 on variable load, oilless centrifugal chillers like magnetic or ceramic bearing chillers and chiller plant manager.   •  Ener gy efficient UPS included Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) based UPS with high efficiency and modular UPS.  •  Other ener gy efficiency initiatives included LED lighting with advanced controls, EFF1/IE3 rated high efficiency motors, 11KV  power distribution from sub-station to different buildings, use of 11 kV centrifugal chillers and elevators with energy efficient and gearless motors.  81 Ther e are some inclusions and modifications in estimating carbon emissions during FY 2023 when compared to FY 2022.     Sc ope 2 emissions: The emission factors for the grid electricity across various geographies have been taken primarily from IEA v5-IEA 2022  (12/2022) database except for US, Canada, Australia, and India where emission factors are available from regional sources. For India geography, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), user guide 18.0, Dec 2022 emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh (carbon emission factor of grid electricity, including RE) has been considered for estimating the carbon emissions from procured electricity in FY 2023. Over the years CEA has been publishing the weighted average carbon emission factor (conventional) of the grid which was being used by TCS for Scope 2 emissions until FY 2022 as emission factors (including RE) was not available earlier. However, in Dec 2022, CEA published the carbon emission factor of grid electricity (including RE) for the first time for years 2013-14 to 2021-22. As TCS procures electricity from the India grid, which is mix of conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh is considered more appropriate. 82 Corr ected Scope 1 emissions data for FY 2022 due to minor changes in fuel consumption data.   83 GRI 305-5, T C-SI-130a.3. TCFD - Metrics and Targets B Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  |  171 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Gr een IT:  Initia tives in green IT focused on data center and IT device consolidation and optimization to reduce the carbon footprint. The  areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data center and equipment rooms. In addition, green  attributes are considered in every asset procurement. TCS’ data centers have a weighted average PUE of 1.66.   T CS’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™)84 initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize  the operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ energy meters and sensors.   R enewable Energy:  The r oof top solar photo voltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 3.4% of total electricity use in  FY   2023. The company increased its renewable energy procurement through a) switch over to green tariffs for its operations in  Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Bhubaneshwar, Pune, and Thane, b) 1 MWp open access power purchase agreements (PPA) signed at Siruseri (as an extension to the previous 12 MWp PPA). The renewable energy procurement has resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 55.2% of total energy use.

Until FY 2022, TCS used the DEFRA 2012, spend based emission factors, which are outdated. In view of adopting updated emission factors, there was a reduction in category 1 by 89% and category 2 by 82%.  •   Ca tegory 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned  vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category in FY 2023. Earlier in FY 2022, only WTT of electricity procured was considered. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 3.5% of the total emissions under category 3. •   Ca tegory 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to  other supplies. In FY 2023, TCS has also included emissions related to non-IT supplies and waste disposal. The supplies include cafeteria/ canteen supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material and other stationary supplies and disposal of wastes (e-wastes, hazardous wastes, batteries etc.,). Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 31% of the total emissions under category 4. •   Ca tegory 5: No change in approach in FY 2023. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of  waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2022.  •   Ca tegory 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at  various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 0.5% of the total emissions under category 6. •   Ca tegory 7: In FY 2023, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees  (global), personal employee commute (only India), public employee commute (only India) and work from home (WFH) emissions (global). In pre-pandemic period, TCS had considered and included private and public commute of India employees in carbon emissions, however during FY 2021 and FY 2022, this was insignificant to be included under this category. The occupancy in overseas offices has been minimum during FY 2023 due to majority of the associates working from home and therefore considered insignificant, and not included in the emissions.

Consolidated Financial Statements  |  183 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of Tata Consultancy Services Limited Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tata  Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as the  Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and  its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which  comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2023,  and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including  other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of  changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for  the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial  statements, including a summary of significant accounting  policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred  to as “the consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according  to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated  financial statements give the information required by the  Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give  a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles  generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs  of the Group as at 31 March 2023, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity  and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our  responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial  Statements s ection of our report. We are independent Consolidated  Financial Statements  of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements  that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial  statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of  the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit  evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Key Audit Matter(s) Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional  judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  consolidated financial statements of the current period. These  matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on  these matters. Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method See Note 5(a) and Note 12 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts,  wherein, revenue is recognized using the percentage  of completion computed as per the input method  based on the Group’s estimate of contract costs. We identified revenue recognition of fixed price  contracts where the percentage of completion is  used as a key audit matter since - •  ther e is an inherent risk and presumed fraud  risk around the accuracy and existence of  revenues recognised considering the customised  and complex nature of these contracts and  significant inputs of IT systems;Our audit procedures included the following: •  Ob tained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls  implemented by the Group for recording and computing revenue  and the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue  balances. •  In volvement of our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as  required: \t  Assessed the IT en vironment in which the business systems  operate and tested system controls over computation of revenue  recognised; \t  T ested the IT controls over appropriateness of cost and revenue  reports generated by the system;  Consolidated Financial Statements  |  184 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •  applic ation of revenue recognition accounting  standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts  with customers) is complex and involves a  number of key judgments and estimates in  mainly identifying performance obligations, related transaction price and estimating the  future cost-to- completion of these contracts,  which is used to determine the percentage  of completion of the relevant performance obligation; •  these c ontracts may involve onerous obligations  which requires critical assessment of  foreseeable losses to be made by the Group;  and •  a t year-end, significant amount of work in  progress (Contract assets), related to these  contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.\t  T ested the controls pertaining to allocation of resources and  budgeting systems which prevent the unauthorized recording/ changes to costs incurred; and \t  T ested on a random sampling basis the controls relating to the  estimation of contract costs required to complete the respective  projects. •  On select ed specific and statistical samples of contracts, we tested that  the revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition  accounting standard including – \t  E valuated the identification of performance obligations and the  ascribed transaction price; \t  F or testing the Group’s computation of the estimation of contract  costs and onerous obligations, if any. We: \t\t•   assessed tha t the estimates of costs to complete were  reviewed and approved by appropriate designated management personnel; \t\t•   perf ormed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred  with estimated costs to identify significant variations and  challenged whether those variations are required to be considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete the contract; \t\t•   assessed the appr opriateness of work in progress (contract  assets) on balance sheet date by evaluating the underlying  documentation to identify possible changes in estimated  costs to complete the remaining performance obligations;  and \t\t•   inspect ed underlying documents and performed analytics to  determine reasonableness of contract costs. Other Information The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the other information. The other information  comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s  Annual R eport, but does not include the financial statements  and auditor’s reports thereon. The Holding Company’s Annual  R eport is expected to be made available to us after the date of  this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not  cover the other information and we will not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing  so, consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our  knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated. Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the  Consolidated Financial Statements The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these  consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive  income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and  consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the  accounting principles generally accepted in India, including  the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under  Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and  Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are  responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records  in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding  the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting  frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application  of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and  estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated  financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,  which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the  consolidated financial statements by the Management and  Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the  respective Management and Board of Directors of the  companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing  Consolidated Financial Statements  |  185 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23the ability of each company to continue as a going concern,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern  and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the  respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the  Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative  but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in  the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting  process of each company. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our  opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but  is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions  of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial  statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit. We also: •  Iden tify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures  responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. •  Ob tain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the company has adequate internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements in  place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. •  E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by the Management and Board   of Directors. •  Conclude on  the appropriateness of the Management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis  of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial  statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to  the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a  going concern. •  E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the consolidated financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance of  the Holding Company and such other companies included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the  independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit  findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate  with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where  applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements  of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter  should not be communicated in our report because the adverse  consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies  incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”). Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for  Internal Financial ControlsThe respective Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on the criteria established by the respective company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Consolidated Financial  Statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023 with reference to financial statements and their operating  effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial StatementsA company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial StatementsBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLID ATED  FINANCIAL S TATEMENTS As per our report of even date attached For and on behalf of the Board For B S R & Co. LLP Chartered AccountantsFirm’s registration no: 101248W/W-100022 Amit Somani PartnerMembership No: 060154Rajesh Gopinathan   CEO and Managing DirectorN Ganapathy Subramaniam   COO and Executive Director Samir Seksaria   CFOPradeep Manohar Gaitonde   Company Secretary Mumbai, April 12, 2023 Mumbai, April 12, 2023Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  196 Integrated Annual Report 2022-231) Corpor ate information  T ata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and  its subsidiaries (collectively together with employee  welfare trusts referred to as “the Group”) provide IT  services, consulting and business solutions and have been  partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses  in their transformation journeys. The Group offers a  consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of  IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is  delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile  delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in  software development.  The Compan y is a public limited company incorporated and  domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS  House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at March  31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company  owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share capital.  The Boar d of Directors approved the consolidated financial  statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and  authorised for issue on April 12, 2023. 2)  St atement of compliance  These c onsolidated financial statements have been  prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting  Standard (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under   section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as  amended from time to time. 3)  Basis of pr eparation  These c onsolidated financial statements have been  prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial  instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured  at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting  period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of  the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date. All  assets and liabilities have been classified as current and  non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle.  Based on the nature of services rendered to customers  and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the  consideration for such services rendered, the Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.  The s tatement of cash flows has been prepared under  indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals  or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or  payments and items of income or expense associated  with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows  from operating, investing and financing activities of the  Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid  investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in  value to be cash equivalents.  The functional curr ency of the Company and its Indian  subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee ( `). The functional currency  of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary  economic environment in which the entity operates.  Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange  rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign  currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the  balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising  on settlement and restatement are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and  liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.  The signific ant accounting policies used in preparation of  the consolidated financial statements have been discussed  in the respective notes. 4)  Basis of c onsolidation  The Compan y consolidates all entities which are controlled  by it.  The Compan y establishes control when; it has power over  the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns  from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to  affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant activities of the entity.  En tities controlled by the Company are consolidated from  the date control commences until the date control ceases.  The r esults of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year  are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and  up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.  The financial s tatements of the Group companies are  consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company  transactions, balances, income and expenses are  eliminated in full on consolidation.  Chang es in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do  not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity  transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s  interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted  to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the  subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which  the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value  of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly  in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.  Asse ts and liabilities of entities with functional currency  other than the functional currency of the Company have  been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such  entities has been translated using weighted average  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  197 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been  reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the  statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation  is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control,  significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative  amount of exchange differences related to that foreign  operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of  profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 5)  Use of es timates and judgements  The pr eparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with the recognition and measurement  principles of Ind AS requires management to make  estimates and judgements that affect the reported  balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent  liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the  periods presented.  Es timates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised  and future periods are affected.  The Gr oup uses the following critical accounting estimates  in preparation of its consolidated financial statements:  (a)  R evenue recognition    R evenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method. The Group uses  judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion  of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.  (b)  Use ful lives of property, plant and equipment    The Gr oup reviews the useful life of property,  plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in  depreciation expense in future periods.  (c)  Impairmen t of goodwill    The Gr oup estimates the value-in-use of the cash  generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash  flows after considering current economic conditions  and trends, estimated future operating results and  growth rate and anticipated future economic and  regulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are  developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates  used for the CGUs represent the weighted average  cost of capital based on the historical market returns of comparable companies.  (d)  F air value measurement of financial instruments    When the f air value of financial assets and financial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets,  their fair value is measured using valuation techniques  including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a  degree of judgement is required in establishing fair  values. Judgements include considerations of inputs  such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the  reported fair value of financial instruments.  (e)  Pr ovision for income tax and deferred tax assets    The Gr oup uses estimates and judgements based  on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of  revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is  exercised while determining the provision for income  tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be  available against which the deductible temporary  differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly,  the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the  carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of  each reporting period.  (f )  Pr ovisions and contingent liabilities    The Gr oup estimates the provisions that have present  obligations as a result of past events and it is probable  that outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect  the current best estimates.    The Gr oup uses significant judgements to assess  contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are  recognised when there is a possible obligation arising  from past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly  within the control of the Group or a present obligation  that arises from past events where it is either not  probable that an outflow of resources will be required  to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the  amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are  neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated  financial statements.  ( g)  Emplo yee benefits    The acc ounting of employee benefit plans in the  nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use  assumptions. These assumptions have been explained  under employee benefits note.  (h)  Leases    The Gr oup evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to  be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116.  Identification of a lease requires significant judgement.  The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the  lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the  applicable discount rate.    The Gr oup determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both  periods covered by an option to extend the lease  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  198 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option; and periods covered by an option to terminate  the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to  exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group  is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend  a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a  lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances  that create an economic incentive for the Group to  exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to  exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group  revises the lease term if there is a change in the non- cancellable period of a lease.    The disc ount rate is generally based on the  incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being  evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar  characteristics. 6)  R ecent pronouncements  Minis try of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard  or amendments to the existing standards under Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to  time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment  Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:  Ind AS 1 – Pr esentation of Financial Statements  The amendmen ts require companies to disclose their  material accounting policies rather than their significant  accounting policies. Accounting policy information,  together with other information, is material when it can  reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary  users of general purpose financial statements. The Group  does not expect this amendment to have any significant  impact in its financial statements.  Ind AS 12 – Inc ome Taxes  The amendmen ts clarify how companies account  for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and  decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed  the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15  and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no  longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition,  give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary  differences. The Group is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.    Ind AS 8 – Acc ounting Policies, Changes in Accounting  Estimates and Errors  The amendmen ts will help entities to distinguish between  accounting policies and accounting estimates. The  definition of a change in accounting estimates has been  replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under  the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary  amounts in financial statements that are subject to  measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting  estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves  measurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect this  amendment to have any significant impact in its financial  statements. 7)  Busi ness combinations  The Gr oup accounts for its business combinations under  acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the  acquisition date.  P urchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value  of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where  the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values  of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is  recognised as capital reserve.  The in terest of non-controlling shareholders is initially  measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling  interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable  net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an  acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition,  the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the  amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the  non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in  equity of subsidiaries.  Business c ombinations arising from transfers of interests in  entities that are under common control are accounted at  historical cost. The difference between any consideration  given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in  shareholders’ equity. 8)   Fina ncial assets, financial liabilities and equity  instruments  Financial asse ts and liabilities are recognised when the  Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially  measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which  are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or  issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair  value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or  financial liability.  The Gr oup derecognises a financial asset only when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all  the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another  entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,  cancelled or have expired. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  199 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Cash and c ash equivalents  The Gr oup considers all highly liquid investments, which  are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are  subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash  equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances  with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and  usage.  Financial asse ts at amortised cost  Financial asse ts are subsequently measured at amortised  cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect  contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the  financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.    Financial asse ts at fair value through other  comprehensive income  Financial asse ts are measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income if these financial assets are held  within a business whose objective is achieved by both  collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding and selling financial assets.  The Gr oup has made an irrevocable election to present  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments  not held for trading in other comprehensive income.  Financial asse ts at fair value through profit or loss  Financial asse ts are measured at fair value through profit  or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at  fair value through other comprehensive income on initial  recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable  to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in  statement of profit and loss.  Financial liabilities  Financial liabilities ar e measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method.  E quity instruments  An equity ins trument is a contract that evidences residual  interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of  its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are  recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.  Deriv ative accounting  •  Ins truments in hedging relationship    The Gr oup designates certain foreign exchange  forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks.  These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.    The Gr oup uses hedging instruments that are  governed by the policies of the Company and its subsidiaries which are approved by their respective  Board of Directors. The policies provide written  principles on the use of such financial derivatives  consistent with the risk management strategy of the  Company and its subsidiaries.    The hedg e instruments are designated and  documented as hedges at the inception of the  contract. The Group determines the existence of  an economic relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged item based on the currency,  amount and timing of their respective cash flows.  The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce  the risk associated with the exposure being hedged  is assessed and measured at inception and on an  ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no  longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately  reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the  statement of profit and loss.    The e ffective portion of change in the fair value of the  designated hedging instrument is recognised in the  other comprehensive income and accumulated under  the heading cash flow hedging reserve.    The Gr oup separates the intrinsic value and time value  of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option.  The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and  time value of an option is recognised in the other  comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified  into the statement of profit and loss when the related  hedged items affect profit and loss.    Hedg e accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no  longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and  accumulated in equity till that time remains and is  recognised in statement of profit and loss when the  forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the  statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes  ineffective.  •  Ins truments not in hedging relationship    The Gr oup enters into contracts that are effective  as hedges from an economic perspective, but they  do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in  the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.  Impairmen t of financial assets (other than at fair value)  The Gr oup assesses at each date of balance sheet whether  a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.  Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  200 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23through a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables  that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Group has used  a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The  provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected  credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For  all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since  initial recognition.

Carr ying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2023 and 2022,  approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other  financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value  due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of  investments carried at amortised cost is `5,587 crore and `1,672 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (j)  F air value hierarchy  The f air value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable  or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:  •  Le vel 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  •  Le vel 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either  directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).  •  Le vel 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in  part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market  transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.  The c ost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide  range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

Under the  guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward,  currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

The Group has a risk management policy which covers risks  associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of  the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse  effects on the financial performance of the Group.  Mark et risk  Mark et risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market  prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates,  interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign  currency exchange rate risk.  •  F oreign currency exchange rate risk    The fluctua tion in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and  loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where  assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering  the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from  fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.    The Gr oup, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any  movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact  the Group’s revenue in international business.    The Gr oup evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It  hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.    The f oreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a  simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of  Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.    The f ollowing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy  Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive  income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by  the Group as disclosed in note 8(k).    The f ollowing table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2023: (` crore) USD EUR GBP Others Net financial assets  3,869  262  90  2,136  Net financial liabilities  (11,021)  (657)  (1,536)  (270)    10% appr eciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its  subsidiaries with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Group’s profit before taxes  by approximately `713 crore for the year ended March 31, 2023.

Hence, the Group is not significantly  exposed to interest rate risk.  Cr edit risk  Cr edit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms  or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well  as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous  basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.  Financial ins truments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments,  derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Inter-corporate deposits of  `1,016 crore are with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies. Bank deposits include  an amount of `4,273 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of  the Group’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023.

Gr oup as a lessee  The Gr oup accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the  contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of  the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.  The Gr oup recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease  commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial  measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  215 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling  and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is  subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted  for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the  commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use  assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment  whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.  The Gr oup measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement  date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily  determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably  similar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease  or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease  payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate  the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease  liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any  reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount  of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit  and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re- measurement in statement of profit and loss.  The Gr oup has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease  term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these  leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Gr oup as a lessor  A t the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group  recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a  finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on  the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease  and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from  the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the  exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.  If an arr angement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with  customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.  The de tails of the right-of-use assets held by the Group is as follows: (` crore) Additions for   the year ended  March 31, 2023Net carrying   amount as at   March 31, 2023 Leasehold land  179  940  Buildings  1,236  6,330  Leasehold improvements  14  30  Computer equipment  73  125  Software licences  -     96  Vehicles  17  34  Office equipment  1  5   1,520  7,560  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  216 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23(` crore) Additions for   the year ended  March 31, 2022Net carrying   amount as at   March 31, 2022 Leasehold land  100  774  Buildings  1,357  6,586  Leasehold improvements  -     23  Computer equipment  4  81  Software licences  145  133  Vehicles  16  32  Office equipment  2  7   1,624  7,636   Depr eciation on right-of-use assets is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023Year ended   March 31, 2022 Leasehold land 10  9  Buildings 1,530  1,465  Leasehold improvements  6  6  Computer equipment  32  23  Software licences 37  38  Vehicles  16  16  Office equipment  3  3  1,634  1,560    Intere st on lease liabilities is `492 crore and `519 crore for for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The t otal cash outflow for leases is `2,538 crore and `2,228 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,  including cash outflow for short term and low value leases.  The Gr oup has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities. The present value of  future cash outflows for such extension periods is `786 crore and `773 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Lease c ontracts entered by the Group majorly pertain for buildings taken on lease to conduct its business in the ordinary course.  The Gr oup does not have any lease restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract. 10)  Non- financial assets and non-financial liabilities (a)  Pr operty, plant and equipment  P roperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing  the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment  loss, if any.  Depr eciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value  over their estimated useful lives based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at  the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  217 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 The es timated useful lives are as mentioned below: Type of asset Useful lives Buildings 20 years Leasehold improvements Lease term Plant and equipment 10 years Computer equipment 4 years Vehicles 4 years Office equipment 2-5 years Electrical installations 4-10 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years  Depr eciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for  its intended use.  P roperty, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying  amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to  sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely  independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU)  to which the asset belongs.  If the r ecoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

(b)  Goodwill    Goodwill r epresents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of  the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated  impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the  implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.    C GUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication  for impairment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic  uncertainties, reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and  subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the  impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other  assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

An analysis of the sensitivity of the  computation to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on  reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease  below its carrying amount.    The r emaining amount of goodwill of `1,173 crore and `1,141 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, (relating  to different CGUs individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs and the  recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts.

In tangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences and customer-related intangibles.    F ollowing table summarises the nature of intangibles and their estimated useful lives: Type of asset Useful lives Rights under licensing agreement and software licences Lower of licence period and 2-5 years Customer-related intangibles 3 years    In tangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life.    In tangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts  may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and  the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely  independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit  (CGU) to which the asset belongs.    If the r ecoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the  asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

The Group offers a consulting- led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.  R evenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the  consideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.  •  R evenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts  expended, number of transactions processed, etc.  •  R evenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide  services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.  •  In r espect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of  accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract  costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  •  R evenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software  is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where  implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services  and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method .  •  R evenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the  customer.  •  The solutions off ered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for  supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the  principal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is  acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.  R evenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level  credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue  also excludes taxes collected from customers.  The Gr oup’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The  Group assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  225 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer  to benefit independently from such deliverables.  Judg ement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each  distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable  consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and  incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant  financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for  a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction  price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will  not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations  to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct  performance obligations.  The Gr oup exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period  of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls  the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such  product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.  Con tract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for  capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of  this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be  used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.  Con tract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified  as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of  time is required, as per contractual terms.  Unearned and de ferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.  The billing schedules agr eed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress  payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.  In acc ordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the  obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.  Con tracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews  modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.  The Gr oup disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.  R evenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023Year ended   March 31, 2022 Consultancy services 2,23,332 1,90,289 Sale of equipment and software licences  2,126  1,465  2,25,458 1,91,754  R evenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note 19).  While disclosing the ag gregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially  satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the  Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price  allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised  corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  226 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Unsa tisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations,  changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc).  The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,38,231 crore  out of which 53.17% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from  contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the  changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with  a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and  unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the  entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.  The r etirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations  reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available  refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.  The Gr oup provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are  treated as defined benefit plans.  De fined contribution plans  Con tributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to  such benefits.  The Gr oup provides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) and foreign defined  contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  228 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Short -term employee benefits  All emplo yee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee  benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the  employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal  or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be  estimated reliably.  Compensa ted absences  Compensa ted absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee  renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are  not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date  using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

The gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in  employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year  of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust.  Trustees administer contributions made to the trust.

The e xpected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure Group’s defined benefit plan obligations as  at March 31, 2023. The Group is expected to contribute `55 crore to defined benefit plan obligations funds for the year ending  March 31, 2024 comprising domestic component of `8 crore and foreign component of `47 crore.  The signific ant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected  salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective  assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.  If the disc ount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023As at   March 31, 2022 Increase of 0.50%  (265)  (372) Decrease of 0.50%  290  422   If the e xpected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as  follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023As at   March 31, 2022 Increase of 0.50% 155 200 Decrease of 0.50%  (147)  (188) Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  233 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 The sensitivity analy sis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is  unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.  Furthermor e, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated  using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the  defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.  E ach year an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are  analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.  The de fined benefit obligations shall mature after year ended March 31, 2023 as follows: (` crore) Year ending March 31, Defined benefit  obligations 2024  755  2025  644  2026  617  2027  618  2028  609  2029-2033  2,722   Pr ovident fund  In acc ordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy Services Limited in India are entitled to receive benefits  under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set  up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit  plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government  administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund  liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there  is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected  amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered  provident fund.  All eligible emplo yees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in  which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident  fund plan. A part of the company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. This plan is a defined  contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly contributions made to the fund. The contributions  made to the fund are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.  The de tails of fund and plan assets are given below: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023As at   March 31, 2022 Fair value of plan assets 25,511 22,814  Present value of defined benefit obligations (25,511) (22,814) Net excess / (shortfall)  -    -     The plan asse ts have been primarily invested in Government securities and corporate bonds.

Super annuation  All eligible emplo yees on Indian payroll are entitled to benefits under Superannuation, a defined contribution plan. The Group  makes monthly contributions until retirement or resignation of the employee. The Group recognises such contributions as an  expense when incurred. The Group has no further obligation beyond its monthly contribution.  The Gr oup expensed `394 crore and `383 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, towards Employees’  Superannuation Fund.  F oreign defined contribution plans  The Gr oup expensed `2,109 crore and `1,796 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, towards foreign  defined contribution plans. 15)  Cos t recognition  Cos ts and expenses are recognised when incurred and have been classified according to their nature.  The c osts of the Group are broadly categorised in employee benefit expenses, cost of equipment and software licences,  depreciation and amortisation expense and other expenses. Other expenses mainly include fees to external consultants,  facility expenses, travel expenses, communication expenses, bad debts and advances written off, allowance for doubtful trade  receivables and advances (net) and other expenses. Other expenses are aggregation of costs which are individually not material  such as commission and brokerage, recruitment and training, entertainment, etc.  (a)  Cos t of equipment and software licences    Cos t of equipment and software licences consist of the following: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023Year ended   March 31, 2022 Raw materials, sub-assemblies and components consumed  37  29  Equipment and software licences purchased  1,846  1,137   1,883  1,166  Finished goods and work-in-progress Opening stock  3  -*  Less: Closing stock  5  3   (2)  (3)  1,881  1,163     *R epresents value less than `0.50 crore.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.  Curr ent income taxes  The curr ent income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas. The  current tax payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian income tax payable after taking credit for tax relief  available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).  Curr ent income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the  jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income  tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.  The curr ent income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary  in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.  Adv ance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and  income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and  liability on a net basis.  De ferred income taxes  De ferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount,  except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is  not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.  De ferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  236 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 The c arrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.  De ferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled  and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  De ferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the  years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.  F or operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of  those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after  the tax holiday ends.  De ferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the  relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.  De ferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be  available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance  sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will  be realised.

These tax holidays are available for a period of fifteen years from the date of commencement of operations. Under the  SEZ scheme, the unit which begins providing services on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for deductions of 100% of profits or  gains derived from export of services for the first five years, 50% of such profits or gains for a further period of five years and 50%  of such profits or gains for the balance period of five years subject to fulfilment of certain conditions.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  239 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Unr ecognised deferred tax assets relate primarily to business losses and tax credit entitlements which do not qualify for  recognition as per the applicable accounting standards.

MAT paid can be carried forward for a period of 15 years and can be set off against the future tax liabilities. MAT is  recognised as a deferred tax asset only when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic  benefit associated with the asset will be realised.  De ferred tax liability on temporary differences of `7,180 crore as at March 31, 2023, associated with investments in subsidiaries,  has not been recognised, as it is the intention of Tata Consultancy Services Limited to reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries for the foreseeable future.         Dir ect tax contingencies  The Compan y and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with income tax authorities in India and in some of the other  jurisdictions where they operate. The disputes relate to tax treatment of certain expenses claimed as deduction, computation  or eligibility of tax incentives and allowances and characterisation of fees for services received. The Company and its subsidiaries  have recognised contingent liability in respect of tax demands received from direct tax authorities in India and other jurisdictions  of `1,542 crore and `1,652 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These demand orders are being contested by the  Company and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation and advise of tax consultants. In respect of tax contingencies  of `318 crore and `318 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, not included above, the Company is entitled to an  indemnification from the seller of TCS e-Serve Limited.  The Gr oup periodically receives notices and inquiries from income tax authorities related to the Group’s operations in the  jurisdictions it operates in. The Group has evaluated these notices and inquiries and has concluded that any consequent income  tax claims or demands by the income tax authorities will not succeed on ultimate resolution.  The number of y ears that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on tax jurisdiction. The major tax jurisdictions of Tata  Consultancy Services Limited include India, United States of America and United Kingdom. In India, tax filings from fiscal 2018  are generally subject to examination by the tax authorities. In United States of America, the federal statute of limitation applies  to fiscals 2017 and earlier and applicable state statutes of limitation vary by state.

The business segments comprise:    1) Banking, Financial Services and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Retail and Consumer Business, 4) Communication, Media and  Technology, 5) Life Sciences and Healthcare and 6) Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, s-Governance and Products.  R evenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses which are not  directly identifiable to each reporting segment have been allocated since associated revenue of the segment or manpower efforts.  All other expenses which are not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable expenses.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  242 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 •  Indir ect tax matters    The Compan y and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with tax authorities mainly relating to treatment of characterisation  and classification of certain items. The Company and its subsidiaries have demands amounting to `568 crore and `568 crore  as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from various indirect tax authorities which are being contested by the Company  and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation and advice of tax consultants.  •  Other claims    Claims ag gregating `277 crore and `291 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, against the Group have not been  acknowledged as debts.    In addition t o above, in October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company  in the Court of Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to and download of their confidential information and use thereof in the development of the Company’s product MedMantra.    In April 2016, the Compan y received an unfavourable jury verdict awarding damages of `7,730 crore (US $940 million) to  Epic which was thereafter reduced by the Trial Court to `3,454 crore (US $420 million). Pursuant to reaffirmation of the  District Court Order in March 2019, the Company filed an appeal in the Appeals Court to fully set aside the Order. Epic also  filed a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the District Court judge of `822 crore (US $100 million) award and   `1,645 crore (US $200 million) in punitive damages.    On Augus t 20, 2020, the Appeals Court (a) vacated the award of `2,303 crore (US $280 million) in punitive damages  considering the award to be constitutionally excessive and remanded the case back to District Court with instructions to  reassess and reduce the punitive damages award to at most `1,151 crore (US $140 million), (b) affirmed the District Court’s  decision vacating the jury’s award of `822 crore (US $100 million) in compensatory damages for alleged use of “other  confidential information” by the Company, and, (c) affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the jury’s award of   `1,151 crore (US $140 million) in compensatory damages for use of the comparative analysis by the Company. Considering  all the facts and various legal precedence, on a conservative and prudent basis, the Company provided `1,218 crore   (US $165 million) towards this legal claim in its statement of profit and loss for three month period ended September 30,  2020. This was presented as an “exceptional item” in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. On April 8, 2021, Epic  approached the Supreme Court seeking review of the Order of the Appeals Court which was denied by the Supreme Court  on March 21, 2022.    On April 21, 2022, Epic in voked payment of `1,151 crore (US $140 million) out of `3,618 crore (US $440 million) Letter of  Credit provided as security, towards compensatory damages awarded by the District Court and confirmed by the Appeals Court, already provided for in the earlier years.    On July 1, 2022, the Dis trict Court passed an Order affirming the punitive damages at `1,151 crore (US $140 million). The  Company has filed an appeal on November 16, 2022, in the Appeals Court to reduce the punitive damages awarded by the  District Court, which is pending.    P ursuant to encashment of the Letter of Credit towards compensatory damages, the value of Letter of Credit made available  to Epic stands reduced to `1,250 crore (US $152 million).  •  Le tter of comfort    The Compan y has given letter of comfort to banks for credit facilities availed by its subsidiaries. As per the terms of letter  of comfort, the Company undertakes not to divest its ownership interest directly or indirectly in the subsidiary and provide  such managerial, technical and financial assistance to ensure continued successful operations of the subsidiary.  The amoun ts assessed as contingent liability do not include interest that could be claimed by counter parties.

Standalone Financial Statements  |  251 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of   Tata Consultancy Services LimitedReport on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the standalone financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2023, and the standalone statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes in equity and standalone statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according  to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2023, and its profit and other comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with Standalone Financial Statements  the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements. Key Audit Matter(s) Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method Refer Note 4(a) and 10 to the standalone financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company inter alia engages in Fixed-price  contracts, wherein, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion computed as per the input method based on the Company’s estimate of contract costs. We identified revenue recognition of fixed price  contracts where the percentage of completion is used as a Key Audit Matter since – 1.  ther e is an inherent risk and presumed fraud  risk around the accuracy and existence  of revenues recognised considering the customised and complex nature of these contracts and significant inputs of IT systems;Our audit procedures included the following: 1.  Ob tained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls  implemented by the Company for recording and computing revenue and  the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue balances. 2. In volvement of our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required:  i.  Assessed the IT en vironment in which the business systems operate  and tested system controls over computation of revenue recognised;  ii.  T ested the IT controls over appropriateness of cost and revenue  reports generated by the system;  Standalone Financial Statements  |  252 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit 2.  applic ation of revenue recognition accounting  standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts  with customers) is complex and involves a number of key judgments and estimates mainly in identifying performance obligations, related transaction price and estimating the future cost-to-completion of these contracts, which is used to determine the percentage of completion of the relevant performance obligation; 3.  these c ontracts may involve onerous  obligations which requires critical assessment of foreseeable losses to be made by the Company; and 4.  a t year-end, significant amount of work in  progress (Contract assets), related to these contracts are recognised on the balance sheet. iii.  T ested the controls pertaining to allocation of resources and  budgeting systems which prevent the unauthorized recording/changes to costs incurred; and  iv .  T ested on a random sampling basis the controls relating to the  estimation of contract costs required to complete the respective projects. 3.  On select ed specific and statistical samples of contracts, we tested that  the revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition accounting standard including–  i.  E valuated the identification of performance obligations and the  ascribed transaction price;  ii. F or testing Company’s computation of the estimation of contract  costs and onerous obligations, if any. We:    •  assessed  that the estimates of costs to complete were reviewed  and approved by appropriate designated management personnel;    •  perf ormed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred with  estimated costs to identify significant variations and challenged whether those variations are required to be considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete the contract;    •  assessed the appr opriateness of work in progress (contract  assets) on balance sheet date by evaluating the underlying documentation to identify possible changes in estimated costs to complete the remaining performance obligations; and    •  inspect ed underlying documents and performed analytics to  determine reasonableness of contract costs. Other InformationThe Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report(s) thereon. The Company’s annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not  cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the  Standalone Financial StatementsThe Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial  statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section   133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes  maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, the  Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease  Standalone Financial Statements  |  253 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the  Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone  Financial StatementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: •  Iden tify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud  or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. •  Ob tain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. •  E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors. •  Conclude on the appr opriateness of the Management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.•   E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

LLP Chartered Accountants Firm’s Registration No.: 101248W/W-100022 Amit Somani Partner Place: Mumbai Membership No.: 060154 Date: 12 April 2023  ICAI UDIN: 23060154BGXCZS4294 Standalone Financial Statements  |  259 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the  aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act (Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal  and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) Opinion We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 March 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,  adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”). Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for  Internal Financial ControlsThe Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial StatementsA company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial StatementsBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  266 Integrated Annual Report 2022-231) Corpor ate information  T ata Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS  Limited” or “the Company”) provides IT services, consulting  and business solutions and has been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.  The Compan y is a public limited company incorporated and  domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at  March 31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share capital.  The Boar d of Directors approved the standalone financial  statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2023. 2)  St atement of compliance  These s tandalone financial statements have been prepared  in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time. 3)  Basis of pr eparation  These s tandalone financial statements have been prepared  on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.  The s tatement of cash flows has been prepared under  indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents. These s tandalone financial statements have been prepared  in Indian Rupee ( `) which is the functional currency of the  Company. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.  The signific ant accounting policies used in preparation of  the standalone financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes. 4)  Use of es timates and judgements    The pr eparation of standalone financial statements  in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.  Es timates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.  The Compan y uses the following critical accounting  estimates in preparation of its standalone financial statements: (a)  R evenue recognition  R evenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method. The Company uses judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation. (b)  Use ful lives of property, plant and equipment  The Compan y reviews the useful life of property, plant  and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods. (c)  Impairmen t of investments in subsidiaries  The Compan y reviews its carrying value of investments  carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss. (d)  F air value measurement of financial instruments  When the f air value of financial assets and financial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  267 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23fair value is measured using valuation techniques including  the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. (e)  Pr ovision for income tax and deferred tax assets  The Compan y uses estimates and judgements based on  the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. (f)  Pr ovisions and contingent liabilities  The Compan y estimates the provisions that have present  obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.  The Compan y uses significant judgements to assess  contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial statements. (g)  Emplo yee benefits  The acc ounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of  defined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note. (h)  Leases  The Compan y evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a  lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.  The Compan y determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company  is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.  The disc ount rate is generally based on the incremental  borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. 5)  R ecent pronouncements  Minis try of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard  or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:  Ind AS 1 – Pr esentation of Financial Statements  The amendmen ts require companies to disclose their  material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.  Ind AS 12 – Inc ome Taxes  The amendmen ts clarify how companies account  for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.    Ind AS 8 – Acc ounting Policies, Changes in Accounting  Estimates and Errors  The amendmen ts will help entities to distinguish between  accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  268 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23measurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect  this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements. 6)   Financial asse ts, financial liabilities and equity  instruments  Financial asse ts and liabilities are recognised when the  Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.  The Compan y derecognises a financial asset only when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged,  cancelled or have expired.  Cash and c ash equivalents  The Compan y considers all highly liquid investments, which  are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are  subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.  Financial asse ts at amortised cost  Financial asse ts are subsequently measured at amortised  cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.    Financial asse ts at fair value through other  comprehensive income  Financial asse ts are measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income if these financial assets are held  within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.  The Compan y has made an irrevocable election to present  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.  Financial asse ts at fair value through profit or loss  Financial asse ts are measured at fair value through profit  or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.  In vestment in subsidiaries  In vestment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less  impairment loss, if any.  Financial liabilities  Financial liabilities ar e measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method.  E quity instruments  An equity ins trument is a contract that evidences residual  interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.  Deriv ative accounting  •  Ins truments in hedging relationship    The Compan y designates certain foreign exchange  forward, currency options and futures contracts as  hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.    The Compan y uses hedging instruments that are  governed by the policies of the Company which are approved by the Board of Directors. The policies provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company.    The hedg e instruments are designated and  documented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.    The e ffective portion of change in the fair value of the  designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.    The Compan y separates the intrinsic value and  time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  269 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23and time value of an option is recognised in the other  comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss.    Hedg e accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.  •  Ins truments not in hedging relationship    The Compan y enters into contracts that are effective  as hedges from an economic perspective, but they  do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Impairmen t of financial assets (other than at fair value)  The Compan y assesses at each date of balance sheet  whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets  is impaired.  Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly  since initial recognition.

Carr ying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, approximate the fair  value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities  which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is  `5,351 crore and `1,470 crore as at  March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (k) F air value hierarchy  The f air value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable  or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:   •  Le vel 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   •  Le vel 2 – Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either  directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).   •  Le vel 3 – Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in  part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.  The c ost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide  range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the  costs are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations.   The Boar d of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk  management plan of the Company which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.

The Company has a risk management policy which covers risks  associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.  Mark et risk  Mark et risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market  prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.  •  F oreign currency exchange rate risk    The fluctua tion in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other  comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.    The Compan y, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further,  any movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact the Company’s revenue in international business.    The Compan y evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It  hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.    The f oreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a  simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.    The f ollowing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet  which could affect the statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed in note 6(l).

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  282 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  •  In terest rate risk     The Compan y’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Company is not  significantly exposed to interest rate risk.    Credit risk    Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the  contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.    Financial ins truments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans,  investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Bank deposits include an amount of `2,428 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which is individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023. None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.    •  Exposur e to credit risk      The c arrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum  exposure to credit risk was `90,655 crore and `90,388 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, being the  total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets.     The Compan y’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of  outstanding trade receivable and contract assets as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.    •  Geogr aphic concentration of credit risk     Geogr aphic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows: As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 Gross% Net% Gross% Net% United States of America  54.14  55.13  52.43  53.78  India  12.03  10.37  12.73  10.68  United Kingdom  15.48  15.80  16.47  16.84      Geogr aphic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on  the location of the customers.

Compan y as a lessee  The Compan y accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the  contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  286 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 The Compan y recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease  commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial  measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.  The Compan y measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement  date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.  The Compan y has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease  term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Compan y as a lessor    A t the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The  Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.   If an arr angement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with  customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.  The de tails of the right-of-use assets held by the Company is as follows: (` crore) Additions for   the year ended  March 31, 2023Net carrying   amount as at   March 31, 2023 Leasehold land  179  940  Buildings  799  4,608  Leasehold improvement  -     2  Computer equipment  -     49  Software licences  -     96  Vehicles  -    -*  978  5,695   *R epresents value less than `0.50 crore.

The t otal cash outflow for leases is `1,732 crore and `1,561 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,  including cash outflow for short term and low value leases.  The Compan y has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities. The present value of  future cash outflows for such extension periods is `786 crore and `722 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Lease c ontracts entered by the Company majorly pertain for buildings taken on lease to conduct its business in the ordinary  course.  The Compan y does not have any lease restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract. 8)  Non- financial assets and non-financial liabilities  (a)  Pr operty, plant and equipment  P roperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing  the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment  loss, if any.  Depr eciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value  over their estimated useful lives based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  288 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 The es timated useful lives are as mentioned below: Type of asset Useful lives Buildings 20 years Leasehold improvements Lease term Plant and equipment 10 years Computer equipment 4 years Vehicles 4 years Office equipment 2-5 years Electrical installations 4-10 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years  Depr eciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for  its intended use.  P roperty, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying  amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to  sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

(b)  In tangible assets    In tangible assets purchased are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation  and accumulated impairment, if any.    In tangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences which are amortised over licence period  which equates the economic useful life ranging between 2-5 years on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic  useful life.    In tangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts  may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.    If the r ecoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the  asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount.

The Company offers a  consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.  R evenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the  consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.  •  R evenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts  expended, number of transactions processed, etc.  •  R evenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide  services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.  •  In r espect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of  accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract  costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  •  R evenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software  is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.  •  R evenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the  customer.  •  The solutions off ered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for  supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.  R evenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level  credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers. Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  295 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 The Compan y’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The  Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.  Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.  Judg ement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each  distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.  The Compan y exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a  period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.  R evenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.  Con tract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for  capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.  Con tract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified  as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.  Unearned and de ferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.  The billing schedules agr eed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress  payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.  In acc ordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the  obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.  Con tracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews  modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.  The Compan y disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.  R evenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023Year ended   March 31, 2022 Consultancy services 1,88,748 1,59,106 Sale of equipment and software licences  1,606  1,235  1,90,354 1,60,341 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  296 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 R evenue disaggregation by industry vertical is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023Year ended   March 31, 2022 Banking, Financial Services and Insurance  68,240  58,614  Manufacturing  16,905  14,576  Retail and Consumer Business  33,169  26,966  Communication, Media and Technology  33,606  28,778  Life Sciences and Healthcare  22,398  18,341  Others  16,036  13,066  1,90,354 1,60,341  R evenue disaggregation by geography is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023Year ended   March 31, 2022 Americas  North Americ a 1,13,208  90,630   La tin America  382  314  Europe  Unit ed Kingdom  30,676  27,595   Con tinental Europe  19,209  17,595  Asia Pacific  12,017  11,178  India  10,941  9,547  Middle East and Africa  3,921  3,482  1,90,354 1,60,341  Geogr aphical revenue is allocated based on the location of the customers.  In formation about major customers  No single cus tomer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2023 and   March 31, 2022.  While disclosing the ag gregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially)  satisfied performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the  Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.  Unsa tisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations,  changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,13,145 crore  out of which 55.41% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the  changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.  The r etirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations  reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.  The Compan y provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which  are treated as defined benefit plans.  De fined contribution plans  Con tributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to  such benefits.  The Compan y provides benefits such as superannuation and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are  treated as defined contribution plans.  Short -term employee benefits  All emplo yee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee  benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

The e xpected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure the Company’s defined benefit plan  obligations as at March 31, 2023. The Company does not expect to contribute to defined benefit plan obligations funds for year ending March 31, 2024 in view of adequate surplus plan assets as at March 31, 2023.  The signific ant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected  salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.  If the disc ount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023As at   March 31, 2022 Increase of 0.50%  (121)  (159) Decrease of 0.50%  127  170   If the e xpected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as  follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023As at   March 31, 2022 Increase of 0.50%  129  171  Decrease of 0.50%  (123)  (161) Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  303 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 The sensitivity analy sis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is  unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.  Furthermor e, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated  using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the  defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.  E ach year an Asset - Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are  analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.  The de fined benefit obligations shall mature after the year ended March 31, 2023 as follows: (` crore) Year ending March 31, Defined benefit  obligations 2024  636  2025  556  2026  534  2027  523  2028  508  2029-2033  2,106   Pr ovident fund  In acc ordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of the Company in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident  fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in statement of profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

The c osts of the Company are broadly categorised in employee benefit expenses, cost of equipment and software licences,  depreciation and amortisation expense and other expenses. Other expenses mainly include fees to external consultants, facility expenses, travel expenses, communication expenses, bad debts and advances written off, allowance for doubtful trade receivables and advances (net) and other expenses.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.  Curr ent income taxes  The curr ent income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company having its branches in India and overseas where it  operates. The current tax payable by the Company in India is Indian income tax payable on income after taking credit for tax relief available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).  Curr ent income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the  jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.  Adv ance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and  income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.  De ferred income taxes  De ferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  306 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 De ferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.  The c arrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.  De ferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the  years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.  F or operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of  those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after  the tax holiday ends.  De ferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the  relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.  De ferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be  available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.

These tax  holidays are available for a period of fifteen years from the date of commencement of operations. Under the SEZ scheme, the unit  which begins providing services on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for deductions of 100% of profits or gains derived from export of services for the first five years, 50% of such profit or gains for a further period of five years and 50% of such profits or gains for the balance period of five years subject to fulfillment of certain conditions.

The Company has recognised contingent liability in respect of tax demands received from direct tax authorities in India and other jurisdictions of `1,471 crore and `1,616 crore as at March 31,  2023 and 2022, respectively. These demand orders are being contested by the Company based on the management evaluation and advise of tax consultants. In respect of tax contingencies of `318 crore and `318 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022,  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  309 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23respectively, not included above, the Company is entitled to an indemnification from the seller of TCS e-Serve Limited.  The Compan y periodically receives notices and inquiries from income tax authorities related to the Company’s operations in  the jurisdictions it operates in. The Company has evaluated these notices and inquiries and has concluded that any consequent  income tax claims or demands by the income tax authorities will not succeed on ultimate resolution.  The number of y ears that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on tax jurisdiction.

Epic also filed a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the District Court judge of `822 crore (US $100 million) award and   `1,645 crore (US $200 million) in punitive damages.    On Augus t 20, 2020, the Appeals Court (a) vacated the award of `2,303 crore (US $280 million) in punitive damages  considering the award to be constitutionally excessive and remanded the case back to District Court with instructions to reassess and reduce the punitive damages award to at most `1,151 crore (US $140 million), (b) affirmed the District Court’s decision vacating the jury’s award of `822 crore (US $100 million) in compensatory damages for alleged use of “other confidential information” by the Company, and, (c) affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the jury’s award of `1,151 crore (US $140 million) in compensatory damages for use of the comparative analysis by the Company.

      "Sure! Mahatma Gandhi was a political and spiritual leader in India who played a significant role in the country's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. Here's a step-by-step explanation of his life and legacy:\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Early Life and Education\n",
      "Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in the state of Gujarat, India. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was a local administrator, and his mother, Putlibai, was a deeply religious woman who had a significant influence on Gandhi's spiritual development. Gandhi was trained as a lawyer and later moved to South Africa, where he experienced discrimination and racism firsthand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: South African Experience and Development of Satyagraha\n",
      "In 1893, Gandhi moved to South Africa to practice law. He was shocked by the racism and discrimination he encountered, and this experience had a profound impact on his beliefs and political views. He developed the concept of Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance), which became the foundation of his political philosophy. Satyagraha emphasizes the power of nonviolent action to bring about social and political change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Return to India and Leadership of the Indian National Congress\n",
      "In 1915, Gandhi returned to India and became involved in the Indian independence movement. He became the leader of the Indian National Congress and advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience as a means to challenge British rule. His methods included boycotts, strikes, and marches, and he was imprisoned several times by the British for his activism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Salt March and Nonviolent Revolution\n",
      "One of Gandhi's most famous acts of nonviolent resistance was the Salt March, which took place in 1930. Gandhi and his followers marched 240 miles from Ahmedabad to the sea to protest the British salt tax, which hurt Indian salt producers and consumers. The march drew international attention and helped galvanize\n"
