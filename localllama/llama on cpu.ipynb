In FY 2023,  your company delivered revenue of ₹225,458 crore, a growth of  17.6%. This growth has come at an industry-leading operating  margin of 24.1%.  TCS continues to play a crucial role with clients to enable  their business transformation, helping them accelerate new  technology adoption and bring agility into execution. We work  with large enterprises on transformation initiatives to build a  digital foundation for the future, enable strategic leverage of  data and artificial intelligence (AI) and reimagine customer and  employee experiences.

From a talent perspective, the employee strength grew to over  614,000 associates with 35.7% women associates. The global environment is going through considerable changes.  Geopolitical factors such as the conflict between Russia and  Ukraine, rising inflation and volatile commodity prices have  caused slowing down of global growth and created stress in the  overall economic environment.  At the same time, the world is navigating several transitions.  Undoubtedly, these transitions will require significant  investments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge  growth opportunity for the IT industry. The global energy transition is accelerating. Businesses are  making clear commitments towards a sustainable future.  There are many  innovations across products, services,  manufacturing, and delivery. New business models are also  emerging. This requires investments in technology and  innovation including electric mobility, renewable power,  hydrogen and sustainable fuel. In addition, sustainability  compliance and reporting requirements are fast evolving as new  standards and regulations are coming into play. Across the facets  of this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be  an important enabler for businesses. The supply chain transition resulting from the geo-political  situation is altering the global supply chains. Companies are  rebalancing their supply chains for resilience and efficiency.  New global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India  playing an important role. This is being led by significant capital  investments in technology to set-up ‘digital-first’ manufacturing  and supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem  integration with partners.

In the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital  technologies, bringing about a transformation across every  industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition  a central focus. The impact of AI and Machine learning is going  to be profound. There is a transition already underway from  predictive AI to generative AI. Majority of the businesses are  still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing  large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT.  There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors.  Leveraging generative AI would further require technology  innovation and investments.  There is another important area that companies need to focus  on – building talent for the future. The energy, supply chain and  AI transitions are going to require companies to reskill/upskill  existing talent base, hire and integrate new talent and invest  in research. Our technology strengths make us well-placed to  respond to the global demand and scale up our talent base.  As the future of work is evolving, enterprises globally are also  assessing their approach to talent. Today, companies can tap  into talent anywhere and leaders need to learn how to harness  the global talent pool effectively. Technology and tools are  facilitating collaboration and enabling virtual and hybrid models  of work. Harnessing this talent will need an approach that  leverages technologies like AI and cloud to enable effective  employee engagement and collaboration.  Your company is significantly investing in building AI capabilities  which include products and platforms that are AI-powered.  Over the last few years, your company has leveraged  partnerships to design and orchestrate a completely indigenous  software-defined 4G/5G network stack. 5G technologies along  with IoT, edge and AI will enable new digital transformation  opportunities across industries,',\n",

Within our growth and transformation (G&T) portfolio, business  model innovation continued to be a key theme. For example,  for a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility, we built the service  delivery platform central to their new business model of  providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement  services of various home appliances to households.  Ingram Micro, one of the largest technology distributors in  the US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot into  e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform from  a traditional distributor to a platform company that does  distribution. Tapestry Inc, a leading New York-based house  of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands such as Coach, Kate  Spade, & Stuart Weitzman, partnered with TCS to drive their  omnichannel modernization and transform the customer  journey experience. Other G&T themes, such as M&A and sustainability continued to  bring in high-profile deal wins and new strategic engagements  for us in FY 2023.

The supplyside challenges of the last two years peaked in  the first half of FY 2023, with employee churn reaching  unprecedented levels. We broke out of the vicious cycle of hiring  and counter-hiring within the industry by investing in onboarding  an unprecedent number of fresh engineers – over 110,000 in  FY 2022 and over 44,000 in FY 2023 – and training them on the  technologies most in demand.  Newer developments like generative  AI, large language models, and  quantum computing triggered more  experimentation and innovation  by our clients. Our investments in  research and innovation across  different industries, and our Pace  innovation architecture have  positioned us well to partner with  them in these initiatives.  Applied at scale, across a broad set of business or IT  operations, this can result in an entirely new operating  model that significantly boosts our clients’ competitiveness.  As macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second half  of the year, we saw clients adapting by reprioritizing their  spends and showing greater interest in such operating model  transformations.  TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite,  has been a game changer, enabling faster transformations  that deliver concrete business benefits within months.

Versuni partnered with TCS in its transformation journey from  strategy through execution, with a vision to embed insights and  agility into core processes, enabling shorter time to value and  quicker responses to market changes through a new cloud-first  application landscape. The program entailed decoupling the  company from the parent’s systems, while simultaneously  transforming it across all business domains, within an ambitious  2-year timeframe.

Leaders in the sector are using technology  innovatively to draw environmentally conscious consumers  looking for greener choices, and grow their new clean energy  businesses.  Eversource Energy is a Fortune 500 energy company that  operates New England’s largest energy delivery system, with  4.4 million customers across Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts  (MA) and New Hampshire. It is focused on making its  operations carbon neutral by 2030, and bringing more  clean and affordable energy to New England. Eversource partnered with TCS to build a solution that  would help them on-board distributed solar power  capacity within its grid by purchasing power  from residential, industrial and commercial  customers who install solar panels and  storage on their properties, and enabling  them to avail of incentives offered by their  respective states, as part of state-level Net  Zero programs.  The TCS-built solution includes onboarding  of new solar customers, a customer  application that helps keep track of the units  generated, and a pricing engine that uses a  declining block pricing mechanism to  incentivize early enrolment as a producer. It  also includes a billing system that processes  recovery charges, solar credits and incentive  payments, and enables flexible payment  options as well as hardship relief options to  improve affordability and increase adoption of  energy efficiency programs. To facilitate quick roll outs across states, TCS  architected a reusable framework that would  simplify adoption of each state’s incentive program  into Eversource’s core platform, enabling the utility to  pursue a very aggressive implementation schedule for  each state.

Using this solution, Eversource has been able to leverage  state incentives to make green energy affordable and rapidly  benefit nearly 430,000 customers in CT and MA so far, while  driving growth of its clean energy business. At the same time,  it is projected to produce over 9,700 MWh of solar power,  accelerating not only its own journey to carbon neutrality but  also that of the states it services.  Making green energy affordable is central to our business  strategy. Its technology enablement was a fairly complex  program with multiple sub-programs running concurrently.  TCS did an outstanding job in collaborating well with multiple  stakeholders and managing risks very well.

KAK: Software that writes software has been around for a  long time. In fact, this is the 50th anniversary of TCS’ very first  offshore development project, delivered using an in-house  code generator. In the 80s, our TRDDC  was famous for its  tools foundry, which could generate custom code translators  on demand, converting source code from any programming  language to any other language. TCS MasterCraft™ is today used by hundreds of our clients  for developing, transforming and maintaining model-based  applications. In fact, our award-winning product suite, TCS  BaNCS™, is written and maintained using MasterCraft. Even  though there is effort involved in defining the model up-front,  clients see significant productivity benefits.  The new low code, no code platforms have done away even  with those overheads. Their graphical drag and drop user  interface empowers people with no coding knowledge to build  sophisticated applications very quickly.  And yet, none of this has led to any demand compression. It has  only led to more growth. We believe generative AI will be no  different. Like prior breakthrough technologies, it will sharply  bring down the effort per function point, driving up programmer  productivity immensely. This will result in greater consumption,  with volume growth more than making up for the effort  deflation. If generative AI takes over coding, won’t the IT services  industry become redundant? require processing of large amounts of unstructured data, text,  images and higher-level abstraction.

Back in 2008, when the term SaaS was still new, we had built a  subscription-based, single instance, multi-tenant core banking  platform using TCS BaNCS for small banks in India. A similar  model is powering start-up banks in Israel today. The insurance  HV: The evidence is empirical. Every new generation of  technology has led to reduction in programming effort per  function point. But while that has steadily fallen, aggregate  spending on IT services has only risen year after year, over  decades. Take for example, the switch from assembly language to C.  Its compilers came with large, extensible libraries of reusable  pre-defined procedures. A developer could invoke a procedure  with one line of code in C and embed its entire logic in the code  base, without actually coding all of it from scratch. Three lines  of C accomplished what took 30 lines in assembly language. The  10x effort deflation didn’t result in mass layoffs of programmers.  Instead, there was an explosion in software development  because the same IT team could now build ten times as many  function points.  Similarly, enterprises adopted offshore outsourcing, it led to a  big cost deflation, but nobody’s IT budgets deflated. Instead,  those savings went into building',\n",

Instead,  those savings went into building new systems and volumes rose  to fill budgets and spending on IT services has only expanded.  Likewise with low-code, no-code platforms. Why is that so? Farm mechanization caused effort  deflation and rendered the agricultural workforce  redundant in the West. Indian IT companies are seen as fast followers on new  technologies. Will that change with generative AI? What is the evidence for this thesis? KAK: With most goods and services, when the price falls, any  increase in volume is limited by how much of that good or  service the market can consume in a defined period. When farm  mechanization reduced the cost of tilling, the increased demand  for men in tractors was not large enough to compensate for the  effort deflation because there was only so much land available  to till.  Demand for IT services behaves differently. In every enterprise,  there is significant unmet demand. Every CIO has limited  capacity for new system development, resulting in a requirement  backlog that never gets fulfilled. Technologies like generative  AI or low code-no code can help a CIO expand capacity and  accomplish much more with the same budget. But even then,  the backlog never goes away because there is no limit on  business users’ ingenuity or competitive drive. Demand just rises  to fill the incremental capacity created by new technologies.  HV: The emergence of new technologies triggers more ideas,  experimentation and more demand for our services. To that  extent, business application of generative AI, along with other  technologies, will itself drive the incremental demand that fills  up the capacity it frees up through higher productivity. platform launched in 2009, with shared services bundled in,  went on to make us the market leader in life and pensions  administration in',\n",

This unprecedented  event at TCS is just a reminder that CEOs are human too,  and might want to pursue their dreams and aspirations just  like anybody else. As for our track record in retaining senior  leadership talent, it remains industry-leading.  I am proud to say that almost the entire team of 25 business  heads we had created in 2008 is still in TCS. We have over  125,000 TCSers today with an average tenure of over 10 years  in TCS. This cohort represents the true strength of TCS. They  are the custodians of our culture, values and institutional  memory, and have been central to our ability to weather the  unprecedented attrition and influx of fresh talent without letting  it affect the high quality of project outcomes that our clients  have come to expect from TCS. We not only retained our leadership talent better, but also  expanded the leadership pool six-fold in the last five years by  incubating a next generation of leaders running sub-ISUs, with  P&L responsibilities. The breadth and depth of our leadership  bench today makes our succession planning an industry  benchmark, with multiple equally-qualified successors for any  leadership position, starting from the CEO down, as you recently  witnessed. SS: Normalizing attrition is definitely a relief, but I wouldn’t call it  a tailwind. We incurred a 1.4% margin headwind in FY 2023 from  backfilling and retention expenses.

Also, with the supplyside challenges easing, incremental  cost of hiring laterals should be lower, and it also gives us an  opportunity to bring down subcontractor expense. That is one  important margin lever for FY 2024. Utilization improvement,  flatter employee pyramid and hopefully, currency support, are  the other levers. On the other hand, we will have our usual wage  increase in Q1 and we should see further increases in travel  expenses during the year. SS: It is not true that large outsourcing deals are necessarily  margin dilutive. A few high profile mega-deals in the industry  whose low quality revenues impacted margins have resulted in  that perception. In the last five years, TCS has won several mega  deals with TCV over $500 million, and every year we win dozens  of large deals, with TCV over $50 million. And yet, during this  period, our EBIT margin has remained in a tight band between  24 and 26 percent. Profitability of large deals depends on how you construct  them.

SS: In the short term, higher onsite wage inflation is a headwind  because our legacy contracts have much lower cost of living  adjustments written in. But in the medium and longer term, this  will get adjusted.  Wage inflation affects everybody in the market including the  clients themselves. Newer contracts reflect the changed cost  structure for onsite effort. Also, contractual terms now peg  annual cost of living increases to prevailing inflation rates.  That  should help mitigate inflation risks in longer term contracts. SS: Inflation differential is not the only driver of currency  depreciation. Rupee is also affected by India’s trade deficit,  interest rate differentials and capital movements. But for  argument’s sake, let us assume that we may not have the benefit  of currency depreciation in the future. Now remember, the  currency depreciation basically helps us offset wage inflation  in India which historically, we never passed on to clients. In  the changed circumstances, this too will get baked into new  contracts the same way onsite wage inflation has been. So in the  longer term, we should be able to sustain our current margins. ML: In my view, the productivity benefits will get baked into  clients’ expectations around project velocity and throughput.  For a given project team size, clients will expect much higher  output at a much faster pace, compared to today. On aggregate,  as the unit price of a function point falls, we expect volumes to  increase. With ever-increasing dependence on technology for  competitive differentiation, we expect enterprise spending to  keep growing, for which we will have to keep hiring new talent.  So the linearity between revenue and headcount is not going  away any time soon. SS: Margins are a measure of relative competitiveness. Based  just on',\n",

Based  just on the productivity improvements in code generation  using generative AI, it is difficult to see how a technology which  is freely available to everyone – service providers as well as  clients’ IT teams – can change relative competitiveness and by  extension, margins. Margin improvement is possible from selling  higher-priced growth and transformation solutions which use  generative AI. Likewise, new software products or platforms  which use generative AI to deliver superior business outcomes.  With laterals brought in at higher salaries, how do you  manage the wage gaps between individuals of similar profile  doing similar work? Will sticky onsite inflation be a structural headwind for your  margins? Without the inflation differential, the Rupee may show greater  strength than in the past. How will your margins sustain then? Finally, a question on generative AI. Will the productivity gains  delink revenue growth from headcount addition in the future?  Can we expect a higher margin as a consequence?   ML: Work from home is definitely more convenient for  everybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who  are well networked within the organization can work effectively  and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up  over the years. That isn’t the case with more junior employees.  Workplace essentials like collaboration, mentorship and team- building suffered a lot in these two years.  Then there is the matter of organizational culture. Over half our  workforce today was hired after March 2020.

Without those interactions,  employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly  impacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people  to our offices during the year. Why is Return to Office so important to TCS? Why not let  employees continue to work from home? ML: Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or  lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be  other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home  during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for  some women, keeping them from returning to office even after  everything normalized.  The higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our  efforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down  on it. Focused leadership development programs like iExcel  are driving tremendous change. Of all the leadership positions  fulfilled with internal candidates in FY 2023, women made up  23% of the selected candidates, even though they account for  only 14% of the applicant pool. This speaks well of the quality  of the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as  the supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting  diversity. Likewise, in our external hiring, women make up 38.1%  of our net hires this year, versus 35.7% in our workforce.  Attrition among women is higher than for men. Why?

The TCS Digital Platform for Next  Generation Agriculture (DNA) is a state-of-the-art, cloud-based  decision intelligence and crop monitoring system that provides  customized, site-specific predictive advisory services to farmers  and other players in the food value chain. TCS DNA uses an innovative `Sky-Earth’ convergence, intelligently  fusing remote-sensing data from earth observation satellites and  drones with data from proximal sensors and handheld devices  on the field. This gives scale and reduces cost significantly  without sacrificing accuracy. Proprietary AI/ML algorithms are  utilized to analyze the data and provide reliable information and  predictive intelligence on weather, soil condition, crop health,  and pest forecasts. Farmers can use these insights to make  quicker and more informed decisions, optimize production costs',\n",

Farmers can use these insights to make  quicker and more informed decisions, optimize production costs  and improve their yield.  Rallis India Ltd, a leading agri-input company, partnered with TCS  for the first field deployment of the new platform, to improve  the productivity of its hybrid seed production farms, as well as  for internal business planning. Branded Drishti (“Vision”), the  platform is used to monitor approximately 130 million hectares  of agricultural land across India, for various aspects such as  crop productivity, soil moisture, early alerts for pest outbreak,  as well as seasonal weather anomalies and extreme weather  events. The platform has helped Rallis increase the field scouting  efficiency of its hybrid seed production team, and improved  yield by 1 to 2%. TCS DNA is also helping Amalgamation Plantations, the second  largest producer of tea in India, improve the quality and  sustainability of tea leaves procured from small tea growers.  It is being used to remotely monitor various aspects of small  plantations using satellite imagery, predict pest and disease  and improve quality. This is expected to help small tea growers  improve their income by 15% and reduce rejections by 20%. Our partnership with TCS is helping us alleviate  the issues of farmers and agriculture. The Drishti  platform identifies problem areas and offers  actionable insights to farmers in India, leading to  effective crop management by reducing the risks  and minimizing the loss in yield.

Central banks raised interest rates  sharply in response. As a result, the global GDP is estimated to  have grown at a more subdued 3.4% in 2022, versus 5.9% in the  prior year1.  Global technology spending on Enterprise software and IT  services crossed the $2 trillion2 mark in 2022, growing 5.5% YoY.  IT services grew 3.5% YoY, to $1,250 billion. This growth was led  by accelerated cloud adoption, preference for external expertise  due to severe talent scarcity, and expanding scope of digital  transformation to cover more back-office operational areas. The global IT services industry continues to be a highly  fragmented one, with even the largest provider having a mid- single digit market share.

       " 'major economies, the heightened risk of a recession  – made worse by a banking crisis – has led to uncertainty in  enterprise decision-making, affecting spending on capex and  certain discretionary programs. Despite this, spending on IT services has been resilient so far.  Cloud migration programs are continuing apace, and clients  continue to launch new G&T projects. The higher level of  uncertainty in the business environment has made clients  more receptive to proactive proposals around IT and business  operating model transformations that can not only deliver  significant efficiencies but also help them become more agile  and resilient. All this has resulted in a strong order book for  FY 2023, at $34.1 Bn, which is 1.2 times revenue. The pipeline  has also grown well. This provides visibility on medium-term growth amid near- term uncertainty. If the delayed decision-making and cash  conservation seen in some segments at the end of FY 2023  flows over into the first half of FY 2024, that could result in some  moderation in full year revenue growth after two years of strong  growth. Key demand drivers expected to power the company’s growth in  FY 2024 include: •  Technology transformation: IT infrastructure  modernization, cloud enablement, application and data  estate modernization, cloud migration, data centre and  collocated data support, digital workplace, digital twins,  cyber security, ERP modernization, low-code no-code, 5G/ Edge and AI adoption. 8  IMF World Economic Outlook Update, April 2023 Management Discussion and Analysis   |  95 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 •  G&T: Customer experience transformation using  personalization, omnichannel implementation, immersive  experiences using XR/Metaverse, product and business  model innovation, supply chain modernization, M&A  integration / divestitures, sustainability. •  Operations: Traditional outsourcing, vendor consolidation  and multi-services deals, AI/ML-led transformation of IT  / business',\n",

Enterprise Risk Management9 FY 2023 saw multiple external and internal challenges continuing  to shape the overall risk profile of the company. Macroeconomic  and geo-political risks had an impact throughout the year.  The Russia-Ukraine war and geo-political tensions, trade wars  and imposed sanctions were pervasive and had direct and  cascading impacts on economies and businesses. Shortages,  rising inflation, supply-chain disruptions, energy crisis led to  further uncertainties in the economic growth environment,  with the year ending with banking industry upheavals in US and  Europe. During the year, IT organizations including TCS faced the  knock-on effects of the pandemic including attrition and impact  of hybrid modes of working. Technological advancements and  breakthroughs like generative AI and metaverse have opened up  new vistas of both risks and opportunities. TCS continues to monitor this uncertain and dynamic business  environment very closely and has strengthened the deployment  of its Enterprise Risk Management framework to address  the risks and leverage the associated opportunities. This  framework enables risk identification, risk assessment, risk  response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk  governance. Key risk indicators and control indicators are used  to anticipate risks and assess effectiveness of their mitigation  actions respectively. TCS takes a holistic view of its enterprise risk profile, covering  strategic, operational, compliance, financial and catastrophic  risks, thus enabling informed decision-making.

The ongoing  Russia-Ukraine war has led to supply  chain disruptions, energy crisis, food  and merchandise scarcities and  related inflation.  •   Persistent high inflation in major  economies could affect consumer  spending and fuel social unrest.  Repeated interest rate hikes by central  banks to rein in the inflation could  result in economic slowdowns.  •   Continuing turmoil in the banking  sector could affect not only spending  in that sector, but also squeeze  liquidity. •   All of these could affect clients’  business outlook and result in reduced  demand for TCS’ services. It could also  increase TCS’ costs of doing business.  •   In addition, there could be risks to  service delivery, business continuity,  cybersecurity, sanctions compliance  and human rights risks in geo- politically sensitive zones, all of which  could increase costs or affect the  company’s revenue growth.  •  Broad-based business mix, well diversified across  geographies and industry verticals. •  Monitor changing geopolitical scenarios, the  potential business implications and strengthen  internal controls to further safeguard against  secondary risks. •  Offerings and value propositions targeting all  stakeholders (in addition to the CIO) in the  customer organization,',\n",

The Company’s philosophy on  corporate governance oversees business strategies and  ensures fiscal accountability, ethical corporate behaviour  and fairness to all stakeholders comprising employees,  investors, customers, regulators, suppliers and the  society at large. Strong leadership and effective corporate  governance practices have been the Company’s hallmark  inherited from the Tata culture and ethos.    The Company follows the Tata Group philosophy of building  sustainable businesses that are rooted in the community  and demonstrate care for the environment. Being a  part of the Tata Group, which epitomizes sustainability,  the Company has inherited a strong legacy of fair and  transparent ethical governance, as embodied in the Tata  Code of Conduct (TCoC).

The Company’s corporate governance philosophy has been  further strengthened through the Tata Business Excellence  Model, the TCS Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider  Trading and the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices  (“Insider Trading Code”). The Company has in place an  Information Security Policy that ensures proper utilization  of IT resources.    The Company is in compliance with the requirements  stipulated under Regulations 17 to 27 read with Schedule  V and clauses (b) to (i) and (t) of sub-regulation (2)  of Regulation 46 of Securities and Exchange Board of  India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)  Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI Listing Regulations”), as  applicable, with regard to corporate governance.    The details of TCS’ board structure and the various  committees that constitute the governance structure1 of  the organization are covered in detail in this report.    The various material aspects of corporate governance and TCS’ approach to them are discussed in the table below: Material Topic TCS’ Approach Board effectiveness,  independence and protection  of minority shareholders’  interests Board effectiveness is enhanced by setting a high bar in selecting the right mix of individuals to  serve on the Board, with the right qualifications, expertise and experience, who can collectively  serve the best interests of all stakeholders, maintain board and management accountability  and drive corporate ethics, values and sustainability.

Corporate Governance Report About TCS | 3 1 GRI 2-9 2 GRI 2-10 Corporate Governance Report   |  114 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Material Topic TCS’ Approach TCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at   https://on.tcs.com/appointment-BoD. Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent  directors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent. None of the independent directors is related to each other,  or to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years. Board effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds  directorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as  an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities. TCS’ governance philosophy around minority shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC  which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse  and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected. TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures  and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and  material developments.

The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured  global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the  management or the Board. Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office  through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’  Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints. Avoidance of conflict of  interest3 Chairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief  Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD). TCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses  covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any   employee – including the executive directors – from accepting any position of responsibility,  with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval.  For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board. Values, Ethics and compliance6 Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and  has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global  business. The Company’s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual,  Excellence, and Learning and Sharing. The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate  citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights,  prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and  avoidance of conflicts of interest. Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based  annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code.

Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through  inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts. Employees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical  behaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company,  which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other  stakeholders can also report any non  - compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by  senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower  Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to  employees as part of the mandatory training modules. 3 GRI 2-15 4 GRI 2-11 5  https://www.tcs.com/tata-code-of-conduct 6 GRI 2-12 Corporate Governance Report   |  115 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Material Topic TCS’ Approach Compliance to laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as global legislation such as  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal compliance  procedures led by the Corporate compliance office.

Tax Strategy7 TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to the  respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner. TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose  of gaining tax advantages. TCS’s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where  available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the  tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a  robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing  the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, by  itself or by its employees or vendors. TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities  worldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the  proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes. Board Oversight of  Sustainability Matters8 TCS’ approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business by  creating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers  and local communities, while also valuing the environment.

Succession  planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior  management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key  functions within their units. Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit  heads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an  opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities. 7 GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2, GRI 207-3.

TCoC also requires its suppliers  to protect the environment and make conscious use of scarce natural resources in their  business processes and at the same time highlighting the importance of health and safety in its  workplace and expects the supplier to comply with sustainable business practices in letter and  spirit in turn for its employees.

Literacy as a Service Adult non-literacy continues to be a problem holding back India  from reaching its full economic potential. Women account for  65% of the illiterate population, and the rest is from marginalized  communities. To address the causes of non-literacy, TCS devised  the Literacy as a Service Program (LaaS) which augments the  Government of India’s eﬀorts to improve literacy. LaaS provides  an innovative teaching method by combining the power of IT  with the theory of cognition and laws of perception.

Modules on the platform include functional literacy (8-10  hours), digital literacy (5-7 hours), and awareness on key citizen  entitlements (3-4 hours), available in 12 languages – nine Indian,  and three foreign. Thus far, LaaS has successfully paved the way to self-reliance  for over 1.13 million learners (~60% women) and more than  200,000 Preraks through literacy. In August 2022, TCS launched the ‘Each one Empowers one’  portal which allows employees of TCS and Tata Group, along  with their families, to empower non-literates in their local  community, such as security guards, domestic workers and  gardeners. The program has generated transforming impact by promoting  social inclusion, ﬁnancial stability and economic growth. It has also  propelled neo-literates to receive better access to government  beneﬁt programs, ﬁnancial systems and empowered them to have  a more signiﬁcant say in family and community decision-making. LaaS Case Study Pyari Ben resides in the Bijori hamlet  of Puwasa village, in Madhya Pradesh’s  Alirajpur district, one of the least literate  and poorest districts in the country. Due  to limited local employment prospects,  villagers from Alirajpur travel for work  to nearby Gujarat cities; Pyari is not an  exception in this regard. She never had the opportunity to  attend school, so she never achieved literacy. This became  diﬃcult because she couldn’t keep track of her hard-earned  daily income as a construction worker.  She gained basic literacy skills after joining the Literacy as  a Service (LaaS) program, which made her realize that her  contractor used to defraud her by not paying her the proper  wages.

Rahul did face challenges initially teaching in virtual mode,  but he overcame it by using eﬀective online teaching skills  like polling, breakout rooms etc. He felt because of the virtual  mode now he can contribute to engineering colleges outside  Maharashtra. In his sessions, Rahul always gives practical  examples which the students can relate to, and understand  better. He also helps these youth in developing conﬁdence so  that they can succeed in all aspects of their lives. Rahul quotes “I felt quite proud as a teacher when my students  secured their dream jobs. My life suddenly seemed to have  a meaning and purpose. Giving is the greatest feeling in the  world, and seeing my students achieve their goals and ﬂourish  in their jobs brings me enormous joy. Continue to contribute  to this worthy cause; these youngsters desperately need  mentoring from TCS YEP Faculties.” TCS Volunteers Deploy with Red Cross, NA In Oct’22, ﬁve TCSers deployed to Florida with the Red Cross  to volunteer in areas impacted by Hurricane Ian, the deadliest  hurricane to have hit Florida in decades.',\n",
       " 'Deploy with Red Cross, NA In Oct’22, ﬁve TCSers deployed to Florida with the Red Cross  to volunteer in areas impacted by Hurricane Ian, the deadliest  hurricane to have hit Florida in decades. Their reasons were  diﬀerent and reﬂected their life experiences. Some signed on  to a 9-day deployment to give back to the community the help  they had received during a natural disaster. Others had served  previously with the military or a service organization and  wanted to use that experience to help. During their deployment, Aria Rahimi, Lewis Hunt, Charu  Mehndiratta, Patty Sanchez, and Niki Shah packed food  supplies and distributed them to aﬀected communities on  Pine Island and other areas in Lee County. They assisted in  identifying and addressing local needs with respect to shelter,  food, health and spiritual services. Business with Purpose Business with Purpose is a distinctive framework that enables  ‘Purpose Partnerships’ with like-minded organizations to  advance access, equity and inclusion around the world. The  function serves as an accelerator for social good and as a  catalyst between purpose-driven organizations. Several studies  and surveys have revealed that consumers are loyal towards  organizations that are “purpose driven” and have an objective of  “giving back to the community.”  Business with Purpose provides opportunities for business  leaders from customers’ organizations to meet their  commitment to the society. This is enabled with strategic and  established programs like goIT, Ignite My Future in School, Youth  Employment which addresses pressing issues in countries where  TCS and its customers live and work. Over 185 customer leaders which include 45 senior executives  participated in various CSR initiatives globally in FY 2023.

       " 'Program This initiative provides advisory and technology consulting  services on pro bono basis, to build capacity and capability for  organizations and non-proﬁts that seek to create social and  environmental impact.  In this digital age, it is imperative for non-proﬁt organizations  to use technology to become sustainable and build trust with  a multitude of stakeholders. TCS’ leadership and employees  provide pro bono technology services to such organizations  to generate sustainable impact. TCS works closely with key  stakeholders to understand their requirements and build the  right software tools that help them establish a digital presence,  raise funds more easily, build transparency in their operations  and work more eﬃciently. This helps those organizations extend their support to more  local and global beneﬁciaries, demonstrating the force multiplier  eﬀect that technology can play.  Millions of dollars of ‘social  value’ have been generated by this program since its inception. International Medical Corps (IMC) Case Study A ﬁrst responder, International Medical Corps (IMC) provides  emergency relief to those struck by conﬂict, disaster, and  disease.  IMC approached TCS seeking help in digitizing their vendor  pre-qualiﬁcation platform, a critical component of the  procurement workﬂow. IMC does not procure supplies from  a vendor who has not completed the qualiﬁcation process or  whose qualiﬁcation has lapsed, which can lead to a shortage of  critical supplies that IMC beneﬁciaries depend on.  The process was arduous and complicated with a high  margin for potential error. After in-depth research seeking  to gain a comprehensive understanding of IMC’s vendor  pre-qualiﬁcation system, TCS redesigned and enhanced the  existing system by placing it in a digital platform that is more  transparent and accessible for IMC’s team. The system oﬀers  IMC a structured workﬂow for maintaining vendor information,  tracking critical vendor qualiﬁcation status, and',\n",

Corporate Social Responsibility  |  143 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Last year, the organization responded directly to the needs of  more than 18 million people in 30 countries on ﬁve continents,  including more than 1 million people in the United States. “Being a ﬁrst responder organization means our work is  fast-paced and vital to vulnerable populations. Working  with TCS enabled us to increase the eﬃciency of our vendor  prequaliﬁcation process, which is critical to our operations,”  said Salma Abdelfattah, Pharmaceutical Services Coordinator,  International Medical Corps. Digital Empowers TCS’s Digital Empowers is a thought leadership initiative that  raises awareness on how digital tools and innovative technology  catalyzes social impact. The program focuses on convening  experts from technology, business, non-proﬁt, public policy,  and academia to ideate, collaborate, and create digitally driven  solutions towards challenges of social impact. TCS has grown the  Digital Empowers community by more than 500 individuals and  the website provides up-to-date information for forums, events  and insight reports. For FY 2023, TCS Digital Empowers, North America partnered  with Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP) and PYXERA  Global to host an eight-part virtual forum series on food security,  the future of work, mental health equity, the digital divide and  disaster response.

The group hosted four expert speakers and spent  more than 150 professional hours to develop three partnership  solution concepts to improve the future of work: 1)  Digital Upskilling - A path to bring down the digital divide for  rural residents over the age of 50 for better participation in  the digital economy. 2)  Generational Workforce Knowledge Retention - A digital  wiki concept developed to support institutional knowledge  retention and cross-pollination of senior knowledge  to juniors enabling the retention of knowledge from a  growing retiring population amidst the high turnover rate  experienced by many organizations. 3)  Equitable Foundation for the Workforce of Tomorrow – An  employee resource group idea designed for a large-scale  group with high accountability and impact to create a safer  and more transparent workplace Purpose Partnerships TCS’ CSR education programs focus on developing 21st century  skills among the underrepresented and socio-economically  weaker sections of society. The National Education Policy 2020  also recommends that skills like computational thinking, design  thinking, problem-solving, and critical thinking should be  included in the curriculum.  The company leverages its industry and social responsibility  expertise to builds the capacity of educators and to nurture  students from marginalized communities globally. This is  achieved through partnerships with the right institutions for  disseminating TCS’ programs such as IMF and goIT which are in  line with nationwide goals.

A matched giving campaign for the company’s  employees and networks was launched to build on the initiatives  of its employees across Europe. TCS employees in the region  collectively donated €130,000 which was matched by TCS,  totalling €260,000. This resulted in a ﬁnal contribution of  €1,260,000. TCS participated in the ‘Sunﬂower Project’, an initiative from  the ‘Tent Partnership for Refugees’. It provided mentoring,  training and upskilling to displaced Ukrainians to support their  economic integration in the host countries. It also organized in- kind donations of more than 300 laptops to schools that support  refugees in Europe. TCS launched several mentorship programs in Europe to help  refugees enter the labor market. This involves capacity building  to strengthen the capabilities of NGOs through participation in  TCS’s Global Community Innovation program and exploration  of the upskilling needs of refugees with TCS Education Business  Units.

Until FY 2022, TCS used the DEFRA 2012, spend based emission factors, which are outdated. In view of adopting  updated emission factors, there was a reduction in category 1 by 89% and category 2 by 82%.  •   Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned  vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category in  FY 2023. Earlier in FY 2022, only WTT of electricity procured was considered. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 3.5% of the total  emissions under category 3. •   Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to  other supplies. In FY 2023, TCS has also included emissions related to non-IT supplies and waste disposal. The supplies include cafeteria/ canteen  supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material and other stationary supplies and disposal of wastes (e-wastes, hazardous  wastes, batteries etc.,). Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. The increase in  scope of reporting contributes to 31% of the total emissions under category 4. •   Category 5: No change in approach in FY 2023. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of  waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2022.  •   Category 6: In FY 2022, business travel included',\n",

In FY 2023, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at  various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022. The increase in scope of reporting contributes  to 0.5% of the total emissions under category 6. •   Category 7: In FY 2023, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees  (global), personal employee commute (only India), public employee commute (only India) and work from home (WFH) emissions (global). In pre- pandemic period, TCS had considered and included private and public commute of India employees in carbon emissions, however during FY 2021  and FY 2022, this was insignificant to be included under this category. The occupancy in overseas offices has been minimum during FY 2023 due  to majority of the associates working from home and therefore considered insignificant, and not included in the emissions.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our  opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but  is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions  of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial  statements.

A company’s internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements include those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations  of management and directors of the Company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of  the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the  consolidated financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements to  future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial  statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and  authorised for issue on April 12, 2023. 2)  Statement of compliance   These consolidated financial statements have been  prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting  Standard (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under   section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as  amended from time to time. 3)  Basis of preparation   These consolidated financial statements have been  prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial  instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured  at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting  period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of  the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date. All  assets and liabilities have been classified as current and  non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle.  Based on the nature of services rendered to customers  and time elapsed between deployment of resources  and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the  consideration for such services rendered, the Group has  considered an operating cycle of 12 months.   The statement of cash flows has been prepared under  indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals  or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or  payments and items of income or expense associated  with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows  from operating, investing and financing activities of the  Group are segregated.

The Group considers all highly liquid  investments that are readily convertible to known amounts  of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in  value to be cash equivalents.   The functional currency of the Company and its Indian  subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`). The functional currency  of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary  economic environment in which the entity operates.  Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange  rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign  currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the  balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising  on settlement and restatement are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and  liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in  foreign currencies are not retranslated.   The significant accounting policies used in preparation of  the consolidated financial statements have been discussed  in the respective notes. 4)  Basis of consolidation   The Company consolidates all entities which are controlled  by it.   The Company establishes control when; it has power over  the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns  from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to  affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant  activities of the entity.   Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from  the date control commences until the date control ceases.   The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year  are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and  up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.   The financial statements of the Group companies are  consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company  transactions, balances, income and expenses are  eliminated in full on',\n",

The financial statements of the Group companies are  consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company  transactions, balances, income and expenses are  eliminated in full on consolidation.   Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do  not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity  transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s  interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted  to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the  subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which  the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value  of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly  in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.   Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency  other than the functional currency of the Company have  been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the  balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such  entities has been translated using weighted average  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  197 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been  reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the  statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation  is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control,  significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative  amount of exchange differences related to that foreign  operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of  profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 5)  Use of estimates and judgements   The preparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with the recognition and measurement  principles of Ind AS requires management to make  estimates and judgements that affect the reported  balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent  liabilities as at the date of consolidated',\n",
       " 'of Ind AS requires management to make  estimates and judgements that affect the reported  balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent  liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the  periods presented.   Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised  and future periods are affected.   The Group uses the following critical accounting estimates  in preparation of its consolidated financial statements:   (a) Revenue recognition     Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method. The Group uses  judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion  of the contracts which is used to determine degree of  completion of the performance obligation.   (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment     The Group reviews the useful life of property,  plant and equipment at the end of each reporting  period. This reassessment may result in change in  depreciation expense in future periods.   (c) Impairment of goodwill     The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash  generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash  flows after considering current economic conditions  and trends, estimated future operating results and  growth rate and anticipated future economic and  regulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are  developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates  used for the CGUs represent the weighted average  cost of capital based on the historical market returns  of comparable companies.   (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments     When the fair value of financial assets and financial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets,  their fair value is measured using valuation techniques  including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The',\n",
       " 'recorded in the balance sheet cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets,  their fair value is measured using valuation techniques  including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable markets  where possible, but where this is not feasible, a  degree of judgement is required in establishing fair  values. Judgements include considerations of inputs  such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the  reported fair value of financial instruments.   (e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets     The Group uses estimates and judgements based  on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of  revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is  exercised while determining the provision for income  tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent  that it is probable that future taxable profit will be  available against which the deductible temporary  differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly,  the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the  carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of  each reporting period.   (f)  Provisions and contingent liabilities     The Group estimates the provisions that have present  obligations as a result of past events and it is probable  that outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end  of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect  the current best estimates.     The Group uses significant judgements to assess  contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are  recognised when there is a possible obligation arising  from past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence  of one or more uncertain future events not wholly  within the control of the Group or a present obligation  that arises from past events where it is either not  probable that an outflow of',\n",

Contingent assets are  neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated  financial statements.   (g) Employee benefits     The accounting of employee benefit plans in the  nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use  assumptions. These assumptions have been explained  under employee benefits note.   (h) Leases     The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to  be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116.  Identification of a lease requires significant judgement.  The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the  lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the  applicable discount rate.     The Group determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both  periods covered by an option to extend the lease  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  198 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option; and periods covered by an option to terminate  the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to  exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group  is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend  a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a  lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances  that create an economic incentive for the Group to  exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to  exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group  revises the lease term if there is a change in the non- cancellable period of a lease.

On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment  Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:   Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements   The amendments require companies to disclose their  material accounting policies rather than their significant  accounting policies. Accounting policy information,  together with other information, is material when it can  reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary  users of general purpose financial statements. The Group  does not expect this amendment to have any significant  impact in its financial statements.   Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes   The amendments clarify how companies account  for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and  decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed  the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15  and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no  longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition,  give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary  differences. The Group is evaluating the impact, if any, in its  financial statements.    Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting  Estimates and Errors   The amendments will help entities to distinguish between  accounting policies and accounting estimates. The  definition of a change in accounting estimates has been  replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under  the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary  amounts in',\n",
       " 'estimates. The  definition of a change in accounting estimates has been  replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under  the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary  amounts in financial statements that are subject to  measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting  estimates if accounting policies require items in financial  statements to be measured in a way that involves  measurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect this  amendment to have any significant impact in its financial  statements. 7)  Business combinations   The Group accounts for its business combinations under  acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs  are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition  for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the  acquisition date.   Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value  of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where  the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed  the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values  of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is  recognised as capital reserve.   The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially  measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling  interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable  net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an  acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition,  the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the  amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the  non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in  equity of subsidiaries.   Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in  entities that are under common control are accounted at  historical cost. The difference between any consideration  given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts',\n",
       " 'from transfers of interests in  entities that are under common control are accounted at  historical cost. The difference between any consideration  given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in  shareholders’ equity. 8)   Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity  instruments   Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the  Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially  measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which  are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or  issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair  value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or  financial liability.   The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire,  or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all  the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another  entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when,  and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,  cancelled or have expired.

Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income   Financial assets are measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income if these financial assets are held  within a business whose objective is achieved by both  collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding and selling financial assets.   The Group has made an irrevocable election to present  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments  not held for trading in other comprehensive income.   Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss   Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit  or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at  fair value through other comprehensive income on initial  recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable  to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in  statement of profit and loss.   Financial liabilities   Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method.   Equity instruments   An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual  interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of  its liabilities.

Derivative accounting   •  Instruments in hedging relationship     The Group designates certain foreign exchange  forward, currency options and futures contracts as  hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks.  These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.     The Group uses hedging instruments that are  governed by the policies of the Company and its  subsidiaries which are approved by their respective  Board of Directors. The policies provide written  principles on the use of such financial derivatives  consistent with the risk management strategy of the  Company and its subsidiaries.     The hedge instruments are designated and  documented as hedges at the inception of the  contract. The Group determines the existence of  an economic relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged item based on the currency,  amount and timing of their respective cash flows.  The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce  the risk associated with the exposure being hedged  is assessed and measured at inception and on an  ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no  longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have  been accumulated in other equity are immediately  reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the  statement of profit and loss.     The effective portion of change in the fair value of the  designated hedging instrument is recognised in the  other comprehensive income and accumulated under  the heading cash flow hedging reserve.     The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value  of an option and designates as hedging instruments  only the change in intrinsic value of the option.

Any gain or  loss recognised in other comprehensive income and  accumulated in equity till that time remains and is  recognised in statement of profit and loss when the  forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and  loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the  statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes  ineffective.   •  Instruments not in hedging relationship     The Group enters into contracts that are effective  as hedges from an economic perspective, but they  do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Fair values are determined in whole or in  part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market  transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.   The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide  range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

       " 'The focus of  the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse  effects on the financial performance of the Group.   Market risk   Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market  prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates,  interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign  currency exchange rate risk.   •  Foreign currency exchange rate risk     The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and  loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where  assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering  the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from  fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.     The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any  movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact  the Group’s revenue in international business.     The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It  hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.     The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a  simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of',\n",

Hence, the Group is not significantly  exposed to interest rate risk.   Credit risk   Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms  or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well  as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous  basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.   Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments,  derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Inter-corporate deposits of  `1,016 crore are with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies. Bank deposits include  an amount of `4,273 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of  the Group’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023. None of the other financial instruments of the Group result in material  concentration of credit risk.   •  Exposure to credit risk     The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum  exposure to credit risk was `1,09,258 crore and `1,05,498 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, being the  total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loan, contract assets and  other financial assets.

The right-of-use asset is  subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted  for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the  commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.

The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease  payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate  the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease  liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any  reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount  of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit  and loss depending upon the nature of modification.

The Group  recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a  finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on  the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease  and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from  the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the  exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU)  to which the asset belongs.

(b) Goodwill     Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of  the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated  impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the  implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.     CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication  for impairment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic  uncertainties, reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and  subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the  impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other  assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

The Group offers a consulting- led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.   Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the  consideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.   •  Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts  expended, number of transactions processed, etc.   •  Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide  services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.   •  In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of  accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract  costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.   •  Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software  is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer.

       " 'is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where  implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services  and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method .   •  Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the  customer.   •  The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for  supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the  principal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is  acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.   Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level  credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue  also excludes taxes collected from customers.   The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The  Group assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  225 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer  to benefit independently from such deliverables.   Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each  distinct performance obligation. The',\n",
       " 'from such deliverables.   Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each  distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable  consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and  incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant  financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for  a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction  price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will  not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations  to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct  performance obligations.   The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period  of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls  the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such  product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.   Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for  capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of  this criteria requires',\n",
       " 'licence costs which meet the criteria for  capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of  this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be  used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.   Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified  as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of  time is required, as per contractual terms.   Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.   The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress  payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.   In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the  obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.   Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews  modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new  performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is  revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.   The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.   Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023 Year ended   March 31, 2022 Consultancy services 2,23,332  1,90,289 Sale of equipment and',\n",

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.   Current income taxes   The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas. The  current tax payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian income tax payable after taking credit for tax relief  available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).   Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the  jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income  tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.',\n",

The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income  tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.   The current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary  in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.   Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and  income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and  liability on a net basis.   Deferred income taxes   Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount,  except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is  not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.   Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled  and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the  years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.   For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of  those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after  the tax holiday ends.   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the  relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.   Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be  available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance  sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will  be realised.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit.

Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls with reference to financial statements  based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with  the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed  under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an  audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial Statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of standalone financial statements for  external purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements include those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations of  management and directors of the company; and (3) provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s  assets that could have a material effect on the standalone  financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial',\n",
       " 'of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s  assets that could have a material effect on the standalone  financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements to  future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  266 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 1)  Corporate information   Tata Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS  Limited” or “the Company”) provides IT services, consulting  and business solutions and has been partnering with many  of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation  journeys. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive  powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and  engineering services and solutions. This is delivered  through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery  model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software  development.   The Company is a public limited company incorporated and  domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS  House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at   March 31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding  company owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share  capital.   The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial  statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and  authorised for issue on April 12, 2023. 2)  Statement of compliance   These standalone financial statements have been prepared  in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards  (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section',\n",
       " '2023. 2)  Statement of compliance   These standalone financial statements have been prepared  in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards  (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to  time. 3)  Basis of preparation   These standalone financial statements have been prepared  on historical cost basis except for certain financial  instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured  at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting  period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of  the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.  All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and  non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle.  Based on the nature of services rendered to customers  and time elapsed between deployment of resources  and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the  consideration for such services rendered, the Company has  considered an operating cycle of 12 months.   The statement of cash flows has been prepared under  indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals  or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or  payments and items of income or expense associated  with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from  operating, investing and financing activities of the Company  are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid  investments that are readily convertible to known amounts  of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in  value to be cash equivalents.   These standalone financial statements have been prepared  in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional',\n",
       " 'of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in  value to be cash equivalents.   These standalone financial statements have been prepared  in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the  Company. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at  exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.  Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and  liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing  on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses  arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in  the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and  liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in  foreign currencies are not retranslated.   The significant accounting policies used in preparation of  the standalone financial statements have been discussed in  the respective notes. 4)  Use of estimates and judgements    The preparation of standalone financial statements  in conformity with the recognition and measurement  principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company  to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported  balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent  liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements  and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the  periods presented.   Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised  and future periods are affected.   The Company uses the following critical accounting  estimates in preparation of its standalone financial  statements: (a) Revenue recognition   Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method. The Company uses  judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion of the  contracts which is used to determine degree of completion  of the performance obligation. (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment   The Company',\n",
       " 'the future cost-to-completion of the  contracts which is used to determine degree of completion  of the performance obligation. (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment   The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant  and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This  reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense  in future periods. (c) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries   The Company reviews its carrying value of investments  carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more  frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the  recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the  impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit  and loss. (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments   When the fair value of financial assets and financial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  267 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 fair value is measured using valuation techniques including  the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these  models are taken from observable markets where possible,  but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is  required in establishing fair values. Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and  volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could  affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. (e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets   The Company uses estimates and judgements based on  the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue,  costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised  while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred  tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that  future taxable profit will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and',\n",
       " 'provision for income tax. A deferred  tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that  future taxable profit will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be  utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement  to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at  the end of each reporting period. (f)  Provisions and contingent liabilities   The Company estimates the provisions that have present  obligations as a result of past events and it is probable  that outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end  of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the  current best estimates.   The Company uses significant judgements to assess  contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised  when there is a possible obligation arising from past events,  the existence of which will be confirmed only by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain  future events not wholly within the control of the Company  or a present obligation that arises from past events where  it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate  of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are  neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial  statements. (g) Employee benefits   The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of  defined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions.  These assumptions have been explained under employee  benefits note. (h) Leases   The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a  lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification  of a lease requires significant judgement. The Company  uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term  (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable  discount rate.   The Company determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together',\n",

The Company determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods  covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company  is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods  covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company  is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In  assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to  exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an  option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts  and circumstances that create an economic incentive for  the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease,  or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The  Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the  non-cancellable period of a lease.   The discount rate is generally based on the incremental  borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a  portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. 5)  Recent pronouncements   Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard  or amendments to the existing standards under Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to  time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment  Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:   Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements   The amendments require companies to disclose their  material accounting policies rather than their significant  accounting policies. Accounting policy information,  together with other information, is material when it can  reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary  users of general purpose financial statements. The  Company does not expect this amendment to have any  significant impact in its financial statements.   Ind AS 12 – Income',\n",
       " 'decisions of primary  users of general purpose financial statements. The  Company does not expect this amendment to have any  significant impact in its financial statements.   Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes   The amendments clarify how companies account  for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and  decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed  the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15  and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no  longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition,  give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary  differences. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in  its financial statements.    Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting  Estimates and Errors   The amendments will help entities to distinguish between  accounting policies and accounting estimates. The  definition of a change in accounting estimates has been  replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under  the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary  amounts in financial statements that are subject to  measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting  estimates if accounting policies require items in financial  statements to be measured in a way that involves  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  268 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 measurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect  this amendment to have any significant impact in its  financial statements. 6)   Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity  instruments   Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the  Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument.

       " 'except for trade receivables which  are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or  issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair  value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or  financial liability.   The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire,  or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all  the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another  entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when,  and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged,  cancelled or have expired.   Cash and cash equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which  are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are  subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash  equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances  with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and  usage.   Financial assets at amortised cost   Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised  cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect  contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the  financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.    Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income   Financial assets are measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income if these financial assets are held  within a business whose objective is achieved by both  collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding and selling financial assets.

The Company has made an irrevocable election to present  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments  not held for trading in other comprehensive income.   Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss   Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit  or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at  fair value through other comprehensive income on initial  recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable  to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in  statement of profit and loss.   Investment in subsidiaries   Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less  impairment loss, if any.   Financial liabilities   Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method.   Equity instruments   An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual  interest in the assets of the company after deducting all  of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company  are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue  cost.   Derivative accounting   •  Instruments in hedging relationship     The Company designates certain foreign exchange  forward, currency options and futures contracts as  hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange  risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow  hedges.     The Company uses hedging instruments that are  governed by the policies of the Company which are  approved by the Board of Directors. The policies  provide written principles on the use of such financial  derivatives consistent with the risk management  strategy of the Company.

The Company determines the existence  of an economic relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged item based on the currency,  amount and timing of their respective cash flows.  The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce  the risk associated with the exposure being hedged  is assessed and measured at inception and on an  ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no  longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have  been accumulated in other equity are immediately  reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the  statement of profit and loss.     The effective portion of change in the fair value of the  designated hedging instrument is recognised in the  other comprehensive income and accumulated under  the heading cash flow hedging reserve.     The Company separates the intrinsic value and  time value of an option and designates as hedging  instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the  option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  269 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 and time value of an option is recognised in the other  comprehensive income and accounted as a separate  component of equity.

The change in  the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.   Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)   The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet  whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets  is impaired.  Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses  to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company  recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets  and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a  financing transaction. In determining the allowances  for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used  a practical expedient by computing the expected credit  loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision  matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical  credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking  information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on  the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance  rates used in the provision matrix.

Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is  `5,351 crore and `1,470 crore as at  March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (k) Fair value hierarchy   The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable  or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:    •  Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    •  Level 2 – Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either  directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).    •  Level 3 – Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in  part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market  transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

The focus of  the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse  effects on the financial performance of the Company.   Market risk   Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market  prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates,  interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes.

The Company offers a  consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.   Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the  consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.   •  Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts  expended, number of transactions processed, etc.   •  Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide  services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.   •  In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of  accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract  costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.   •  Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software  is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where  implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services  and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.   •  Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is',\n",
       " 'as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.   •  Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the  customer.   •  The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for  supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the  principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is  acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.   Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level  credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue  also excludes taxes collected from customers. Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  295 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23   The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The  Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.  Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer  to benefit independently from such deliverables.   Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each  distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable  consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and  incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the',\n",
       " 'or variable  consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and  incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant  financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for  a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction  price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will  not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations  to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct  performance obligations.   The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a  period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who  controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of  such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.   Revenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.   Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for  capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of  this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be  used to satisfy future performance obligations and',\n",
       " 'The assessment of  this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be  used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.   Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified  as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of  time is required, as per contractual terms.   Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.   The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress  payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.   In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the  obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.   Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews  modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new  performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is  revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.

Reputation Reputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasingly  aware of climate change related issues. It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to maintain  TCS’ reputation.  Acute physical Acute physical risks associated with extreme weather events is relevant as TCS has substantial operations in  coastal cities in India which are exposed to potential extreme weather events like heavy precipitation, flood,  and cyclones. E.g., The company offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, Kochi are  exposed to physical risks from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place.  Chronic physical Having presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic  physical impacts like change in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, with  TCS’s presence in coastal cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Kochi, Trivandrum, Kolkata, rise in sea level and related  impacts like land submergence, salt water intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems are  more likely. These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure. 6   TCFD Strategy A, B and C.

Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across value  chain and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification  of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value drivers analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain  including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs,  operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End markets (demand for low  carbon services/ products, market share and competition). In the transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approach  has been selected as its more conservative scenario. The inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs  and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis  also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand.
