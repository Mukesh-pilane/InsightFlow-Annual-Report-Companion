      "Dear Shareholder,\n",
      "I am pleased to share that your company has done well in a volatile global environment in the year gone by. In FY 2023, your company delivered revenue of ₹225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6%. This growth has come at an industry-leading operating margin of 24.1%.\n",
      "TCS continues to play a crucial role with clients to enable their business transformation, helping them accelerate new\n",
      "technology adoption and bring agility into execution. We work with large enterprises on transformation initiatives to build a digital foundation for the future, enable strategic leverage of data and artificial intelligence (AI) and reimagine customer and employee experiences.\n",
      "Your company delivered healthy client metrics enabled by new customer additions and deep client relationships.\n",
      "In FY 2023, growth has come from broad-based performance across markets and industry verticals. The order book continues to be strong, indicating demand for your company’s services.\n",
      "From a talent perspective, the employee strength grew to over 614,000 associates with 35.7% women associates.\n",
      "The global environment is going through considerable changes. Geopolitical factors such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising inflation and volatile commodity prices have caused slowing down of global growth and created stress in the overall economic environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the world is navigating several transitions. Undoubtedly, these transitions will require significant investments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge growth opportunity for the IT industry.\n",
      "The global energy transition is accelerating. Businesses are making clear commitments towards a sustainable future. There are many innovations across products, services, manufacturing, and delivery. New business models are also emerging. This requires investments in technology and innovation including electric mobility, renewable power, hydrogen and sustainable fuel. In addition, sustainability\n",
      "compliance and reporting requirements are fast evolving as new standards and regulations are coming into play. Across the facets of this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be an important enabler for businesses.\n",
      "The supply chain transition resulting from the geo-political situation is altering the global supply chains. Companies are rebalancing their supply chains for resilience and efficiency.\n",
      "New global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India playing an important role. This is being led by significant capital investments in technology to set-up ‘digital-first’ manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem integration with partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital technologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition\n",
      "a central focus. The impact of AI and Machine learning is going to be profound. There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI. Majority of the businesses are still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT.\n",
      "There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors. Leveraging generative AI would further require technology innovation and investments.\n",
      "There is another important area that companies need to focus on – building talent for the future. The energy, supply chain and AI transitions are going to require companies to reskill/upskill existing talent base, hire and integrate new talent and invest\n",
      "in research. Our technology strengths make us well-placed to respond to the global demand and scale up our talent base.\n",
      "As the future of work is evolving, enterprises globally are also assessing their approach to talent. Today, companies can tap into talent anywhere and leaders need to learn how to harness the global talent pool effectively. Technology and tools are facilitating collaboration and enabling virtual and hybrid models of work. Harnessing this talent will need an approach that leverages technologies like AI and cloud to enable effective employee engagement and collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your company is significantly investing in building AI capabilities which include products and platforms that are AI-powered.\n",
      "Over the last few years, your company has leveraged partnerships to design and orchestrate a completely indigenous software-defined 4G/5G network stack. 5G technologies along with IoT, edge and AI will enable new digital transformation opportunities across industries, both industrial and consumer. We will also invest in research areas important for the future, in collaboration with our global academic partners and start-up ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to thank Rajesh Gopinathan for his contribution during his tenure as CEO & MD and I wish him the very best for the future. I also take this opportunity to wish K Krithivasan the very best in his new role as CEO & MD of your company.\n",
      "On behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services, I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.\n",

      "Our full services capability enables us to help our clients thrive, in good times and bad. During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and expand their technology-led innovation to differentiate themselves and drive growth. On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times ahead.\n",

      "Letter to\n",
      "Shareholders1\n",
      "Dear Stakeholder,\n",
      "Demand for our services showed remarkable resilience even as other parts of the technology universe deflated, and macroeconomic uncertainties worsened in our major markets throughout FY 2023. Our revenue for the year was ₹225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6% over the prior year (13.7% in constant currency).\n",
      "\n",
      "This growth came with an industry leading operating margin of 24.1%. Our Net Margin was at 18.7%. The Earnings Per Share was at ₹115.19, a growth of 11.2% over the prior year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From an industry vertical perspective, growth in FY 2023 was led by Retail and Consumer Business, which grew 22.1%, Life Sciences and Healthcare which grew 20.2% and Communications, Media and Technology which grew 18.1%. Banking, Financial Services and Insurance grew 14.6% while Manufacturing grew 14.1%. Others, which make up 8.2% of revenues, grew 22.5%.\n",
      "By geographic markets, North America grew 24.2%, UK grew 11.4% and Continental Europe grew 9.2%. Among emerging markets, Latin America grew 24.8%, India grew 14.9%, Middle East & Africa grew 12.5% while Asia Pacific grew 7.1%.\n",
      "The Board has recommended a final dividend of ₹24 per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to ₹115 per share. For the full year, the company’s shareholder payout was\n",
      "₹42,079 crore, 108.2% of the free cash flow during the year.\n",
      "Innovate, Adapt, Thrive\n",
      "Our performance this year reflects how much of an enterprise staple IT services have become. Our full services capability enables us to help our clients thrive, in good times and bad. During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and expand their technology-led innovation to differentiate themselves and drive growth. On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using\n",

      "technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times ahead.\n",
      "Cloud transformation remained a high priority area for enterprises in FY 2023, with greater focus on execution. They engaged us to take up the modernization and migration of their bigger, more complex workloads. The breadth and depth of our cloud expertise, our scale, deep domain knowledge, strong partnership credentials with the hyperscalers and our portfolio of intellectual property on the cloud, give us a distinct competitive edge in this phase of the cloud adoption cycle.\n",
      "We also helped clients cope with the challenge of managing cloud expenses. In some cases, it required rearchitecting their application stack to be more cloud native, capable of\n",
      "dynamically ramping up resource consumption during periods of high demand, and automatic ramping down at other times. Elsewhere, we offered our FinOps advisory and cloud managed services to rein in cloud costs.\n",
      "The adoption of cloud technologies continues to drive innovation within enterprises. The availability of compute, data\n",

      "and networks at scale provides access to powerful technologies like advanced analytics and machine learning, applied to diverse areas like computer vision, text and speech processing, in domains like dynamic supply chain optimization, new molecule discovery in life sciences and usage-based pricing of insurance coverage.\n",
      "Newer developments like generative AI, large language models, and quantum computing triggered more experimentation and innovation by our clients. Our investments in research and innovation across different industries, and our Pace innovation architecture have positioned us well to partner with them in these initiatives. Our Agile Innovation Cloud offering, where\n",
      "we create dedicated, location-independent innovation teams to help clients accelerate and scale up their innovation, gained further traction in FY 2023. 7 new clients signed up during the year, bringing the total to 30 clients.\n",
      "Some of the emerging innovation themes that we helped customers with include ecosystem and multi-industry models underpinned by technologies like data marketplaces, API and blockchain, in industries like transportation and public sector; AI-powered autonomous robotics in the logistics industry, and new applications for digital twins in the BFSI, Telecom and Retail industries.\n",
      "Within our growth and transformation (G&T) portfolio, business model innovation continued to be a key theme. For example, for a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility, we built the service delivery platform central to their new business model of providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement services of various home appliances to households.\n",
      "Ingram Micro, one of the largest technology distributors in the US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot into\n",
      "e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform from a traditional distributor to a platform company that does distribution. Tapestry Inc, a leading New York-based house\n",
      "of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands such as Coach, Kate Spade, & Stuart Weitzman, partnered with TCS to drive their omnichannel modernization and transform the customer journey experience.\n",
      "Other G&T themes, such as M&A and sustainability continued to bring in high-profile deal wins and new strategic engagements for us in FY 2023. Elsewhere in this report, you can read about the work we did for Philips Domestic Appliances in its journey to be a standalone company, and how we helped Eversource Energy pursue its carbon neutrality aspirations.\n",
      "Digital transformation, which began in the front office, towards enhancing customer experience, made further inroads within the enterprise during the year, unlocking tremendous value\n",
      "in the middle and back office. As critical technologies such as machine vision and conversational systems get better with the use of AI, our Machine First™ approach is helping clients use them innovatively in the back office, embedding them into reimagined processes to drive greater velocity, agility, throughput and resilience – which, among other things, also enhances customer experience.\n",

      "Applied at scale, across a broad set of business or IT operations, this can result in an entirely new operating model that significantly boosts our clients’ competitiveness. As macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second half of the year, we saw clients adapting by reprioritizing their spends and showing greater interest in such operating model transformations.\n",
      "TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite, has been a game changer, enabling faster transformations\n",
      "that deliver concrete business benefits within months. Its 600 pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions enable plug and play transformation of a range of business and technology functions, horizontal and vertical. Nearly 300 of our clients have used it to transform their business and IT operations.\n",
      "In traditional outsourcing deals, we saw more multi-services integrated deals. By consolidating multiple elements of the operation stack – processes, applications, and the underlying technology and infrastructure – with a single strategic partner, clients not only achieve greater accountability, but also reduce complexity and derisk their larger business transformations. The same rationale is driving more vendor consolidation initiatives that favor a few strategic partners with end-to-end service offerings, the right innovation capabilities and scale.\n",
      "All these trends play to our strengths. Our scale, structure, and ability to bring together different capabilities into a seamless service delivery team, helped us win several large deals throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investing in People\n",
      "The supplyside challenges of the last two years peaked in the first half of FY 2023, with employee churn reaching\n",
      "unprecedented levels. We broke out of the vicious cycle of hiring and counter-hiring within the industry by investing in onboarding an unprecedent number of fresh engineers – over 110,000 in\n",
      "FY 2022 and over 44,000 in FY 2023 – and training them on the technologies most in demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "In FY 2023, we focused on utilizing the spare capacity built up in the prior year, and recalibrated our hiring especially as attrition started falling in the second half of the year. Our LTM attrition in IT services for the year was 20.1%. Net addition in FY 2023 was 22,600, and the closing headcount was 614,795. Our workforce continued to be very diverse, with over 150 nationalities represented and with women making up 35.7% of the employee base.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our investments in organic talent development continue to deliver exceptional outcomes. In FY 2023, TCSers logged\n",
      "48.3 million learning hours, and acquired nearly 6 million competencies. Popular technologies witnessed unprecedented levels of interest from our employees. During the year, 53,000 TCSers acquired certification on hyperscaler cloud skills, bringing the total number to over 110,000, making TCS one of the Top 2 partners to the largest cloud providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caring for Communities\n",
      "We continued to work with communities across the world, pursuing our long-standing commitment to programs in the areas of skills development, bridging of digital divides and STEM education. In FY 2023, we estimate that our community initiatives touched the lives of over 4.5 million beneficiaries – women, youth and members of marginalized communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our large programs in India around literacy, digital entrepreneurship and youth skilling continued to gain scale. Likewise, our STEM initiatives outside India. goIT is shaping the next generation of digital innovators in 42 countries, while Ignite my Future in School program has doubled its original goal, serving over 2 million students and educators in five geographies worldwide since inception in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our employee volunteer program called HOPE (Hours of Purpose by Employees) resulted in over 2.8 million hours of volunteering effort towards promoting issues most relevant in their local communities, such as mental health, climate action, circularity, education, skilling, mentoring, and conservation.\n",
      "On the environmental front, we continue to make good progress in our net zero journey. We have brought down our absolute carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 71% over base year 2016, meeting our target two years ahead of time. This was despite increased electricity consumption in FY 2023 from employees’ return to office. In addition to enterprise- wide initiatives for energy efficiency, we have also significantly increased our use of renewable energy. Renewable energy sources today make up 55% of the total (7.25% in 2016).\n",
      "So long, farewell\n",
      "This year marks a key milestone in my journey with TCS, and an important transition point for the company, as I step down\n",
      "from my role as CEO and MD on 31st May 2023. It has been an absolute privilege and an unparalleled learning experience to lead our company in the last six years, a period of tremendous growth and transformation for us.\n",
      "On a more personal note, I am grateful to Chandra, our Chairman, for his mentorship and backing over the years, to our Board members for their guidance, and to all our customers\n",
      "for the confidence they reposed in us. I take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues whose support and trust made\n",
      "my journey as CEO successful, satisfying and unforgettable. I also thank all my fellow TCSers whose energy, dedication and aspirations continue to power the organization’s success.\n",
      "I have had the pleasure of interacting with some of you in person over the last decade. Your feedback and insights helped me learn and shaped my worldview. Thank you for all your support and encouragement.\n",
      "With enterprises relying on technology ever more to drive their competitive differentiation, technology intensity is rising and on a secular basis, the share of IT services within overall tech\n",
      "spending is also going up. I am confident that TCS’ best years are ahead, and I look forward to watching the company’s continued success from outside.\n",

Leveraging our AIC, we rapidly built POCs every quarter, some of which got turned into MVPs and rolled out across the enterprise. In just\n",
      "eight months, dozens of innovation ideas were identified, and 24 progressed to become MVPs.\n",
      "One reason for this high yield is that our teams leverage their contextual knowledge, learned over years spent immersed in the client’s IT and business landscape, to come up with ideas deeply rooted in that organization’s reality and therefore more likely to succeed.\n",
      "Generative AI is the talk of the season. What is the business opportunity around it?\n",
      "KAK: We see interest in exploring use cases right across the enterprise. The most obvious areas are conversational systems, content creation and digital marketing, and activities which\n",
      "require processing of large amounts of unstructured data, text, images and higher-level abstraction.\n",
      "Legal and procurement teams can use it to trawl through contracts to identify specific clauses, or prepare a summary of variations of a particular clause. HR could use it for handling employee queries. Sales and customer service want smart assistants that can explain product features and answer questions. In IT, generative AI can create basic code snippets or quality check developed code for adherence to standards.\n",
      "These are just the initial ideas based on the standalone capabilities of generative AI. Over time, you will see newer use cases that are more combinatorial, driving greater spending by enterprises and expanding the opportunity significantly.\n",
      "If generative AI takes over coding, won’t the IT services industry become redundant?\n",
      "KAK: Software that writes software has been around for a long time. In fact, this is the 50th anniversary of TCS’ very first offshore development project, delivered using an in-house code generator. In the 80s, our TRDDC was famous for its tools foundry, which could generate custom code translators on demand, converting source code from any programming language to any other language.\n",
      "TCS MasterCraft™ is today used by hundreds of our clients for developing, transforming and maintaining model-based applications. In fact, our award-winning product suite, TCS BaNCS™, is written and maintained using MasterCraft. Even\n",

      "The new low code, no code platforms have done away even with those overheads. Their graphical drag and drop user interface empowers people with no coding knowledge to build sophisticated applications very quickly.\n",
      "And yet, none of this has led to any demand compression. It has only led to more growth. We believe generative AI will be no different. Like prior breakthrough technologies, it will sharply bring down the effort per function point, driving up programmer productivity immensely. This will result in greater consumption, with volume growth more than making up for the effort deflation.\n",

      "What is the evidence for this thesis?\n",
      "HV: The evidence is empirical. Every new generation of technology has led to reduction in programming effort per function point. But while that has steadily fallen, aggregate spending on IT services has only risen year after year, over decades.\n",
      "Take for example, the switch from assembly language to C.\n",
      "Its compilers came with large, extensible libraries of reusable pre-defined procedures. A developer could invoke a procedure with one line of code in C and embed its entire logic in the code base, without actually coding all of it from scratch. Three lines of C accomplished what took 30 lines in assembly language. The 10x effort deflation didn’t result in mass layoffs of programmers. Instead, there was an explosion in software development because the same IT team could now build ten times as many function points.\n",
      "Similarly, enterprises adopted offshore outsourcing, it led to a big cost deflation, but nobody’s IT budgets deflated. Instead, those savings went into building new systems and volumes rose to fill budgets and spending on IT services has only expanded. Likewise with low-code, no-code platforms.\n",
      "Why is that so? Farm mechanization caused effort deflation and rendered the agricultural workforce redundant in the West.\n",
      "KAK: With most goods and services, when the price falls, any increase in volume is limited by how much of that good or service the market can consume in a defined period. When farm mechanization reduced the cost of tilling, the increased demand for men in tractors was not large enough to compensate for the effort deflation because there was only so much land available to till.\n",
      "Demand for IT services behaves differently. In every enterprise, there is significant unmet demand. Every CIO has limited capacity for new system development, resulting in a requirement backlog that never gets fulfilled. Technologies like generative\n",
      "AI or low code-no code can help a CIO expand capacity and accomplish much more with the same budget. But even then, the backlog never goes away because there is no limit on business users’ ingenuity or competitive drive. Demand just rises to fill the incremental capacity created by new technologies.\n",
      "HV: The emergence of new technologies triggers more ideas, experimentation and more demand for our services. To that extent, business application of generative AI, along with other technologies, will itself drive the incremental demand that fills up the capacity it frees up through higher productivity.\n",
      "Indian IT companies are seen as fast followers on new technologies. Will that change with generative AI?\n",
      "KAK: We have been leaders for a while, but perceptions can be too rooted in historic stereotypes to recognize the change. Back in 2008, when the term SaaS was still new, we had built a subscription-based, single instance, multi-tenant core banking platform using TCS BaNCS for small banks in India. A similar model is powering start-up banks in Israel today. The insurance\n",
      "platform launched in 2009, with shared services bundled in, went on to make us the market leader in life and pensions administration in the UK.\n",
      "Historically, gaining leadership in IT services on any new technology required just training sufficient numbers of people in that technology, ahead of market demand. In the last decade, we not only did that at scale on the entire class of digital technologies, but also invested in higher order capabilities so we could advise our clients on how best to harness the combinatorial power of new technologies in their specific business context.\n",
      "We scaled up our Research and Innovation, exploring use cases across different industries, creating solutions and showcasing them at our innovation centers. We expanded COIN, created new innovation frameworks and set up Pace Ports, our\n",
      "co-innovation hubs, across the world. Today, we not only have a large number of patents, but also the largest portfolio of products and platforms in our peer set, helping win large transformational engagements that uniquely distinguish us.\n",
      "We are helping clients explore and develop end-to-end scenarios in combining technologies like quantum computing, generative AI, 5G and the emerging 6G, and new concepts in cyber security. Here in India, we have stitched together a fully indigenous network stack for 4G and 5G, a unique achievement that differentiates us from our global peers.\n",
      "Elsewhere, we are pursuing 5G-enabled opportunities in operational technologies such as autonomous machines and remote operations. We are looking at emerging cross-industry ecosystem business models in sustainability and energy transition, which will be the big drivers of growth in the coming years.\n",

      "\n",
      "Takenaka’s Vision for 2030 aims to realize a fourth industrial revolution in the building industry by embracing digital transformation across the construction value chain. It is addressing key problems facing the industry in Japan, such as labor shortage, by using digital technologies to increase employee productivity and improve the work-life balance of employees. Its innovation initiatives include AI-based design and construction planning, next-generation work sites with construction robots and remotely operated cranes, and environmentally conscious smart buildings with\n",

      "ML: One swallow does not a summer make. This unprecedented event at TCS is just a reminder that CEOs are human too,\n",

      "We not only retained our leadership talent better, but also expanded the leadership pool six-fold in the last five years by incubating a next generation of leaders running sub-ISUs, with P&L responsibilities.

      "Is normalizing attrition a margin tailwind for FY 2024? What is your margin outlook for the year?\n",
      "SS: Normalizing attrition is definitely a relief, but I wouldn’t call it a tailwind. We incurred a 1.4% margin headwind in FY 2023 from backfilling and retention expenses. If we onboarded a lateral hire at a 20% premium during the year, that increase in employee cost is a recurring one. But yes, hopefuly we won’t have any new headwind due to attrition in FY 2024.\n",
      "Also, with the supplyside challenges easing, incremental cost of hiring laterals should be lower, and it also gives us an\n",
      "opportunity to bring down subcontractor expense. That is one important margin lever for FY 2024. Utilization improvement, flatter employee pyramid and hopefully, currency support, are the other levers. On the other hand, we will have our usual wage increase in Q1 and we should see further increases in travel expenses during the year.\n",
      "You won many large outsourcing deals in FY 2023, and your highest ever number of large deals in Q4. Won’t this hurt margins in FY 2024?\n",
      "SS: It is not true that large outsourcing deals are necessarily margin dilutive. A few high profile mega-deals in the industry whose low quality revenues impacted margins have resulted in that perception. In the last five years, TCS has won several mega deals with TCV over $500 million, and every year we win dozens of large deals, with TCV over $50 million. And yet, during this period, our EBIT margin has remained in a tight band between 24 and 26 percent.\n",
      "Profitability of large deals depends on how you construct them. A client might push for a certain amount of absolute cost reduction at the time of contract renewal. The service provider can either drop prices and sacrifice margins to deliver those\n",
      "\n",
      "savings, or propose a completely different operating model that uses lesser effort, protects or even expands margins, and achieves the client’s objectives.\n",
      "TCS has differentiated itself in this space with the latter approach. Its win-win propositions reimagine the customer’s operating model, leveraging AI and machine learning to reduce human intervention while improving process velocity and operational resilience. Customers have really taken to this idea. In FY 2023, we signed 29 large operating model transformation deals, covering business as well as IT operations, compared to 18 in the prior year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attrition among women is higher than for men. Why? How are you addressing this?\n",
      "ML: Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalized.\n",
      "The higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our efforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down on it. Focused leadership development programs like iExcel\n",
      "are driving tremendous change. Of all the leadership positions fulfilled with internal candidates in FY 2023, women made up 23% of the selected candidates, even though they account for only 14% of the applicant pool. This speaks well of the quality of the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as\n",
      "the supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting diversity. Likewise, in our external hiring, women make up 38.1% of our net hires this year, versus 35.7% in our workforce.\n",
      "Why is Return to Office so important to TCS? Why not let employees continue to work from home?\n",
      "ML: Work from home is definitely more convenient for everybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who are well networked within the organization can work effectively and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up over the years. That isn’t the case with more junior employees. Workplace essentials like collaboration, mentorship and team- building suffered a lot in these two years.\n",
      "Then there is the matter of organizational culture. Over half our workforce today was hired after March 2020. New employees get acculturated through physical interactions with senior colleagues and leaders, by observing and following their behaviors and ways of thinking. Without those interactions, employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly impacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people to our offices during the year.\n",
      "With laterals brought in at higher salaries, how do you manage the wage gaps between individuals of similar profile doing similar work?\n",
      "ML: Yes, this is another unusual, industry-wide problem. The pay disparities will eventually go away for two reasons.\n",
      "One, we are running a program called Elevate that empowers employees to take control of their careers and pursue their aspirations by achieving certain learning goals. Meeting those goals can result in significant pay increases, perhaps even a doubling of salary. Second, there will be a natural time-correction through performance-linked wage increases, promotions and voluntary attrition.\n",
      "Will sticky onsite inflation be a structural headwind for your margins?\n",
      "SS: In the short term, higher onsite wage inflation is a headwind because our legacy contracts have much lower cost of living adjustments written in. But in the medium and longer term, this will get adjusted.\n",
      "Wage inflation affects everybody in the market including the clients themselves. Newer contracts reflect the changed cost structure for onsite effort. Also, contractual terms now peg annual cost of living increases to prevailing inflation rates. That should help mitigate inflation risks in longer term contracts.\n",
      "Without the inflation differential, the Rupee may show greater strength than in the past. How will your margins sustain then?\n",
      "SS: Inflation differential is not the only driver of currency depreciation. Rupee is also affected by India’s trade deficit, interest rate differentials and capital movements. But for argument’s sake, let us assume that we may not have the benefit of currency depreciation in the future. Now remember, the currency depreciation basically helps us offset wage inflation\n",
      "in India which historically, we never passed on to clients. In the changed circumstances, this too will get baked into new\n",
      "contracts the same way onsite wage inflation has been. So in the longer term, we should be able to sustain our current margins.\n",
      "Finally, a question on generative AI. Will the productivity gains delink revenue growth from headcount addition in the future? Can we expect a higher margin as a consequence?\n",
      "ML: In my view, the productivity benefits will get baked into clients’ expectations around project velocity and throughput. For a given project team size, clients will expect much higher output at a much faster pace, compared to today. On aggregate, as the unit price of a function point falls, we expect volumes to increase. With ever-increasing dependence on technology for competitive differentiation, we expect enterprise spending to keep growing, for which we will have to keep hiring new talent. So the linearity between revenue and headcount is not going away any time soon.\n",
      "SS: Margins are a measure of relative competitiveness. Based just on the productivity improvements in code generation using generative AI, it is difficult to see how a technology which is freely available to everyone – service providers as well as clients’ IT teams – can change relative competitiveness and by\n",
      "extension, margins. Margin improvement is possible from selling higher-priced growth and transformation solutions which use generative AI. Likewise, new software products or platforms which use generative AI to deliver superior business outcomes.\n",

      "In keeping with the Tata Group’s purpose-driven worldview, TCS’ vision is to empower people and communities to build self-reliance through technology while promoting the values of fairness, equity and respect for human rights. Its mission is to connect people to opportunities in the digital economy while\n",
      "building equitable, inclusive pathways for all – especially women,\n",
      "youth, and marginalized groups.\n",
      "TCS invests in addressing the most pressing needs of the community through various CSR initiatives and programs focused on education, skilling, employment, and entrepreneurship, aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). With a focus on bridging gaps in access to opportunities, TCS also invests\n",
      "in social innovation and community projects targeted the poorest sections of society, and supports programs addressing basic health and wellness, water sanitation and hygiene, conservation, and disaster relief efforts across the globe.\n",
      "TCS leverages its intellectual capability, technological expertise, financial capacity and the skills of its employees to support wide-reaching, high-impact programs for social impact. These comprehensive programs are designed to be holistic and adaptable for community empowerment and lasting societal development.\n",
      "Over 150,000 TCSers served their local communities by volunteering 2.8 million hours in FY 2023, impacting the lives of over 1.25 million people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, TCS empowered 4.5 million people across the world\n",
      "during the year, creating equitable and inclusive pathways for\n",
      "million women, 581,000 youth and 1.3 million marginalized people through its strategic CSR programs.\n",
      "Key highlights:\n",
      "Closed the literacy gap for 1.13 million Indians, including a pioneering public-private partnership reaching all 52\n",
      "districts of Madhya Pradesh with the State Literacy Mission Authority.\n",
      "GoIT continues to empower the next generation of innovators in school; 41,971 students across 28 countries are now digital innovators, solving real-world problems.\n",
      "Ignite my Future helped 293,697 students across India, US, Canada and ANZ learn computational thinking.\n",
      "Nearly half the goIT and IMF beneficiaries are girls and over 70% from minorities and underserved groups.\n",
      "Youth Employment Program (YEP) empowered 10,869 rural youth, creating new pathways to 21st century jobs, and now reaches students across every state and union territory in India.\n",
      "BridgeIT program is helping marginalized youth turn into digital entrepreneurs and earn well, providing essential last- mile services for 1,736 villages in rural India.\n",

      "Literacy as a Service\n",
      "Adult non-literacy continues to be a problem holding back India from reaching its full economic potential. Women account for 65% of the illiterate population, and the rest is from marginalized communities. To address the causes of non-literacy, TCS devised the Literacy as a Service Program (LaaS) which augments the Government of India’s efforts to improve literacy. LaaS provides an innovative teaching method by combining the power of IT with the theory of cognition and laws of perception. LaaS adopts creative means of delivery to enable functional literacy, such as animated graphic patterns for easy visual and auditory learning.\n",
      "Modules on the platform include functional literacy (8-10 hours), digital literacy (5-7 hours), and awareness on key citizen\n",
      "entitlements (3-4 hours), available in 12 languages – nine Indian,\n",
      "and three foreign.\n",
      "Thus far, LaaS has successfully paved the way to self-reliance for over 1.13 million learners (~60% women) and more than 200,000 Preraks through literacy.\n",
      "In August 2022, TCS launched the ‘Each one Empowers one’ portal which allows employees of TCS and Tata Group, along with their families, to empower non-literates in their local community, such as security guards, domestic workers and gardeners.\n",
      "The program has generated transforming impact by promoting social inclusion, financial stability and economic growth. It has also propelled neo-literates to receive better access to government benefit programs, financial systems and empowered them to have a more significant say in family and community decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignite My Future (IMF)\n",
      "Ignite My Future is a teacher professional development program which introduces the concept of computational thinking into all core subjects. This is a transdisciplinary education program that transforms the way students learn.\n",
      "IMF has generated a great impact through professional development offerings, special projects as well as volunteer and customer engagements with the partnered schools. IMF’s Learning Leaders community supports the growing global community of partnered educators, committed to learnings about the power of computational thinking. This year, IMF India launched Learning Leaders’ regional chapters, catering to\n",
      "regional learning requirements of the teachers from the partner districts across India.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the IMF’s pioneering STEM initiative interventions, Global Innovations Project (GIP) aims to connect students and teachers from around the world as they explore and solve real-world problems using computational thinking.\n",

      "Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category in FY 2023. Earlier in FY 2022, only WTT of electricity procured was considered. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 3.5% of the total emissions under category 3.\n",
      "Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to other supplies. In FY 2023, TCS has also included emissions related to non-IT supplies and waste disposal. The supplies include cafeteria/ canteen supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material and other stationary supplies and disposal of wastes (e-wastes, hazardous wastes, batteries etc.,). Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 31% of the total emissions under category 4.\n",
      "Category 5: No change in approach in FY 2023. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2022.\n",
      "Category 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 0.5% of the total emissions under category 6.\n",
      "Category 7: In FY 2023, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees (global), personal employee commute (only India), public employee commute (only India) and work from home (WFH) emissions (global). In pre- pandemic period, TCS had considered and included private and public commute of India employees in carbon emissions, however during FY 2021 and FY 2022, this was insignificant to be included under this category. The occupancy in overseas offices has been minimum during FY 2023 due to majority of the associates working from home and therefore considered insignificant, and not included in the emissions.\n",

      "The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.\n",
      "Basis of consolidation\n",
      "The Company consolidates all entities which are controlled by it.\n",
      "The Company establishes control when; it has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant activities of the entity.\n",
      "Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.\n",
      "The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.\n",
      "The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n",
      "Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted\n",
      "to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.\n",
      "Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency other than the functional currency of the Company have been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such entities has been translated using weighted average\n",

      "exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to that foreign operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n",
      "Use of estimates and judgements\n",
      "The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported\n",
      "balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.\n",
      "Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are\n",
      "recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.\n",
      "The Group uses the following critical accounting estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\n",
      "Revenue recognition\n",
      "Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method. The Group uses judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.\n",
      "Useful lives of property, plant and equipment The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods.\n",
      "Impairment of goodwill\n",
      "The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates used for the CGUs represent the weighted average cost of capital based on the historical market returns of comparable companies.\n",
      "Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets\n",
      "where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.\n",
      "Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets The Group uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of\n",
      "revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.\n",
      "Provisions and contingent liabilities\n",
      "The Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n",
      "The Group uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "Employee benefits\n",
      "The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note.\n",
      "Leases\n",
      "The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116.\n",
      "Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.\n",
      "The Group determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease\n",
      "\n",
      "if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend\n",
      "a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the non- cancellable period of a lease.\n",
      "The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\n",
      "Recent pronouncements\n",
      "Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:\n",
      "Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements\n",
      "The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n",
      "Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes\n",
      "The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and\n",
      "decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Group is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.\n",
      "Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n",
      "The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial\n",
      "statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n",
      "Business combinations\n",
      "The Group accounts for its business combinations under acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit\n",
      "and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.\n",
      "Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.\n",
      "The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.\n",
      "Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under common control are accounted at historical cost. The difference between any consideration given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in shareholders’ equity.\n",
      "Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity\n",
      "instruments\n",
      "Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair\n",
      "value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.\n",
      "The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash and cash equivalents\n",
      "The Group considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\n",
      "Financial assets at amortised cost\n",
      "Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n",
      "Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n",
      "Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.\n",
      "The Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.\n",
      "Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable\n",
      "to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n",
      "Financial liabilities\n",
      "Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n",
      "Equity instruments\n",
      "An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.\n",

      "The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging\n",
      "instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no\n",
      "longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.\n",
      "The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.\n",
      "The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option.\n",
      "The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss.\n",
      "Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss.

The\n",

The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix.

      "The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.

      "At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\n",

      "Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions processed, etc.\n",
      "Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.\n",
      "In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where\n",
      "implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method .\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.\n",
      "The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.\n",
      "Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.\n",
      "The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Group assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.\n",
      "Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.\n",
      "The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls\n",
      "the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\n",
      "Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\n",
      "Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.\n",
      "Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.\n",
      "The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\n",
      "In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.\n",
      "Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\n",

      "Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with\n",

      "A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\n",
      "and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n",
      "(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.\n",

      "Reference to Financial Statements\n",
      "Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n",

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n",
      "All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources\n",

      "These standalone financial statements have been prepared in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n",

The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.\n",
      "Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets\n",
      "The Company uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised.

      "The Company uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will\n",

Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole.

      "The Company earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.\n",
      "Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\n",
      "Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions processed, etc.\n",
      "Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.\n",
      "In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where\n",
      "implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.\n",
      "The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.\n",
      "Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.\n",
      "Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.\n",
      "The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\n",
      "Revenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.\n",
      "Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\n",
      "Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.\n",
      "Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.\n",
      "The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\n",
      "In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.\n",
      "Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\n",

Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n",
